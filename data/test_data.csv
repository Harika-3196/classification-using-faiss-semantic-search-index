"It's noisy, but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume, it works fine. I bought it cause Gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product.",music,noisy find equalize tone volume works fine bought cause gilmour uses effect certainly one uses must much better quality product
With some trials using different tubes this pedal can add something that is very tough to get otherwise. I run my guitar direct because I don't like amps or having to cart the things around. There are so many shades of tone available that it's tough to really praise this gadget enough especially considering the low cost. I also found using a compresser before it helps. I have a Pigtronix Philosopher's Tone & it made a big differrence. I highly reccomend this tube pre-amp & encourage trying out different tubes to get the sound you want.,music,trials using different tubes pedal add something tough get otherwise run guitar direct like amps cart things around many shades tone available tough really praise gadget enough especially considering low cost also found using compresser helps pigtronix philosopher tone made big differrence highly reccomend tube pre amp encourage trying different tubes get sound want
"Its a great pedal, sound really crunchy, I got a peavy vyper sometime I use this If I want a crunchy style, but the amp I got is really good and has its own distortion styles, I use the heavy metal config on this pedal, I recomend it to anyone... does not introduce noise, I run it on the stock battery, it still works, you can make your guitar sound like Metallica or Megadeth, of course it also depends on a lot of things, like pickups, amp, etc..., I also have a very old little peavey practice amp, this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life.Listen to it on the Boss website, I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them, but it does sound really really close. regards. forgive my english... not from the U.S",music,great pedal sound really crunchy got peavy vyper sometime use want crunchy style amp got really good distortion styles use heavy metal config pedal recomend anyone introduce noise run stock battery still works make guitar sound like metallica megadeth course also depends lot things like pickups amp etc also old little peavey practice amp blows away distortion less noise gives new life listen boss website heard thought sound going similar equipment used sound really really close regards forgive english u

"This thing sounds amazing- except for one small problem: At higher gain settings it hisses like a mother. I'm not talking about extreme settings, just gain and &#34;character&#34; (thats what Tech 21calls it- forgot what Joyo calls it) at 3 o'clock. It has a beautiful WARM singing lead tone-better than any pedal that I have owned ( and that's probably 20-30 distortion/overdrive pedals) If only it didn't hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal. If you have a Rocktron Hush or other noise gate pedal, it is worth considering. The Joyo is an EXACT clone of the Tech 21British pedal, which costs $189 (?). I don't know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not.",music,thing sounds amazing except one small problem higher gain settings hisses like mother talking extreme settings gain character thats tech calls forgot joyo calls clock beautiful warm singing lead tone better pedal owned probably distortion overdrive pedals hiss much would main lead pedal rocktron hush noise gate pedal worth considering joyo exact clone tech british pedal costs know tech hissing problem

"Not sure that title is good grammar, but anyway: I have gotten so much use out of my H2!  I'm a music teacher, and I have recorded music classes and performing groups.  Being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye (and ear-) opening for those kids!It is very easy to use.  The various recording quality settings are useful, so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more space-saving mp3 setting.You can record stereo from just in front of the unit, or you can turn on 4-way, all-around recording.I've used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments.  I often record one part of a duet, then play along with it.You can do some editing on the unit, but it's easier to download the track and use some software to do it.  I have gone direct to disk, though, just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end, which is some of the editing you can do on the H2.There is little to fault with it.  It takes a while to rename a track, for instance, but there again you could do it on your desktop after you download.Prior to this I had a Sony minidisc recorder, which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time I bought it. I finally got tired of messing with discs.I am very glad I got the H2.",music,sure title good grammar anyway gotten much use h music teacher recorded music classes performing groups able easily record class listen really eye ear opening kids easy use various recording quality settings useful anything high quality record space saving mp setting record stereo front unit turn way around recording used mine lot also recording various instruments often record one part duet play along editing unit easier download track use software gone direct disk though cutting little noise beginning end editing h little fault takes rename track instance could desktop download prior sony minidisc recorder right really already obsolete time bought finally got tired messing discs glad got h

I still love these things. I remember spending over $60 for a guitar tuner in the 80's and having to unplug from the amp to plug into the tuner to tune and then back to the amp with my guitar hanging round my neck. Now??? I just clip it and forget it till I need it and push it's little button. If I forget to turn it off it has an auto off feature if it detects no vibration for a while. A new batterry lasted me almost two years. My first tuner's battery it came with lasted over a year. Expect to pay $5 TO $6 for a replacement battery. My more recent Snarks are still running on original batteries.,music,still love things remember spending guitar tuner unplug amp plug tuner tune back amp guitar hanging round neck clip forget till need push little button forget turn auto feature detects vibration new batterry lasted almost two years first tuner battery came lasted year expect pay replacement battery recent snarks still running original batteries

"Let's admit first that this stuff doesn't actually taste like sugar. It has a bitter, artificial taste.So do artificial sweeteners, and plenty of people use those. If you don't object to the taste of diet sodas, for example, Sun Crystals could be a more wholesome, or at least a more natural alternative for sweetening your coffee. You can also bake with them, something which isn't true of most artificial sweeteners.Sun Crystals recycles and donates 1% of their sales to environmental causes. If you can enjoy the flavor, give it a try. For me, black coffee is a better alternative.",grocery,let admit first stuff actually taste like sugar bitter artificial taste artificial sweeteners plenty people use object taste diet sodas example sun crystals could wholesome least natural alternative sweetening coffee also bake something true artificial sweeteners sun crystals recycles donates sales environmental causes enjoy flavor give try black coffee better alternative

"I've had one of these for about 20 years, have gigged with it extensively, and I've only had to replace it once. (more on that later).I'm not really a cork-sniffer re: guitar tone.  I think most of our tone comes from our fingers, and so the trend in the last several years toward high dollar guitar cables is lost on me.  I think this Monster cable sounds fine.  Better?  Well, better than what?  I don't really notice a difference when I use different cables.  Maybe a slight difference in the high frequencies, but it's so slight as to be negligible.I look for guitar cables that will last.  That's what I really care about, and so far this Monster cable does the trick.  I use other brands, too - this is my most expensive cable but I think it was worth the $40 I spent all those years ago.Oh, and the return process.  This was maybe 10 years ago.  I called Monster, they gave me their address and I had to pay about $3 to ship it back to them.  About 2 weeks later I had a new cable.

"My hair is so thick, naturally curly, so frizzy, I live in Florida, the Sunshine State and the Super Humid State as well, I've tried from A to Z to tame my frizzy hair, from famous brands as Moroccan oil, Ojon, Straight Sexy Hair, Alterna Caviar, Paul Mitchel Awapuhi Keratin Products, and so on. I could say these products help a lot, but nothing seems to be good enough for my type of hair and this humid weather. I even have compared my hair with the weather, totally unpredictable!!! Until I got this product on my hands...this is the only product so far which I could say bye-bye to the frizz for good, even on a very humid day. Now I'd see my curls well define, I have beautiful natural curls, my mother is latina, my father chinese, my hair is from the mix of these two genes. Every body at work admire my hair and always receive compliments on how beautiful my curls look, I used to have my hair on a pony tail most of the time. I found this product at Macy's the cost is $20.00 so I don't really see any big difference in between Macy's and Amazon's price. I would buy it over and over again, on dry or humid conditions, I will always have it in my beauty products as one of the ""must have""... I'd like to add something else to this comment of mine. First of all people are writing on their comments about ""STENCH"", to me that word is for something completely unpleasant, and let me say this: I am a very selective person when I have to pick a perfume or even a disinfectant to clean my house, strong smells get me headache and even nausea, certainly this product isn't good because it's smell, to me a good product is because it works...the smell of this product isn't like candy, flowers or perfumes, I wish it could smell the same as Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin, but it doesn't!, so when I apply this product I try to put some over my hair while is damp, and after it gets dry as well, I don't blow dry my hair. The smell goes away after a while, doesn't stay on my hair for a whole day neither!...Now I don't understand the second opinion of a consumer, she wrote: the hair feels rough after you rinsed the product off your hair, YOU DON'T RINSE THIS PRODUCT OFF YOUR HAIR, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE IT ON! The 10 oz. bottle cost is $20.00 and I use my hair long, I have very thick hair and believe me that bottle has been with me for months already, probably from 4 to 5 months, it lasts for ever!!!.

"The text on this can of No Fear Super Energy Supplement is very blurred, like the red ink doesn't line up with the rest of the print on the can, so I didn't try too hard to read it before I started drinking it.  I was a little more than halfway through the can when I realized that there are two servings per can--does anyone save half a can for later?  If you can figure out a way to do that it's probably a good idea, since each serving will give you 33 grams of sugar in the form of high fructose corn syrup.  I could have eaten a candy bar and come out ahead.All that sugar, plus 87 mg of caffeine (per serving) did give my skull wings, right before the sugar crash that followed.The flavor is far too sweet for my tastes, with kind of a weird fruit flavor.  It felt like the inside of my mouth was coated with syrup, like I'd been drinking cough syrup.  Come to think of it, this would probably make a great flavor for kids' cough syrup.It wouldn't work as a kids' drink, though.  The label warns: ""Not recommended for children, pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine.""  Those who are allergic should know that it also contains soy.If you're looking for a sugar boost but couldn't possibly eat another bag of Skittles, this is for you.

"Let me start by saying I love a good sweet/sour tasting lemonade on a hot day, but this product does not make it sweet nor sour.I assume to squeeze flavor into such a small bottle, and to appease traditional water drinking people who are conscience of their calorie intake, the designers of this product decided to use Sucralose.

"Tone control didn't work so it was returned.  But it was pretty nice even though I felt the fret-board quality is higher on my 900 Gibson Les Paul but what can you expect.  If I had to order it again I would pay 140 more and get the SG 400 which has the quality pickups.  The sound is let's say... average.  Good beginner guitar, or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups.  The bolt-in neck didn't bother me but the SG 400 doesn't have that which is another reason I would step up next time.  Shape is ok.  Purely subjective.  I like the solid Les Paul shape now a little better since it's more conservative.  But the size is good and almost more comfortable than the Les Paul style.  Can't believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks.  Also, even though I was tempted with the faded finish, the glossy finish is really nice.

For the money this is a tremendous pedal.  The next step up might be the new MXR Bonamassa tube pedal but that is almost double the price.

"I've been playing mostly acoustics over 30 years, I own a D35 Martin, Epiphone DR-212, Zager ZAD50, American Fender Strat, Gibson Studio Les Paul and have owned many others.  When my Little Red Traveler showed up at my door I was excited, but my expectation bar wasn't set too high.  I unpacked the Traveler and gave it the once over,, WOW, nicely made. Neck was perfect, just the slightest bow, frets were finished better than my Gibson when I bought it.  I found some wet/dry sand paper, I think 200 grit and spent about 10-15 minutes sanding down the bottom of the bridge bone. WOW #2 the action is much above average acoustic guitar quality, no buzz, perfect pitch at the octave and is a joy to play.  The tone is unique, not quiet, and unless you are expecting Martin sound, definitely not offensive.  The sound is kind of acoustic guitar/ukulele, banjo ish.

These boxes are definitely easier to handle overall too; they take up less space in the refrigerator and because of the shape they are easier to tuck in amongst the other contents.  The flip-top is also convenient.  I will note that when you first open one of these, when pouring it might chug a bit if you pour such that there is no air opening left at the spout end.  I suppose you could poke a hole on top somewhere to alleviate this; but I don't find it to be a serious problem.",grocery,brand boxed milk tastes great much say really convenient boxed milk hand even still buy regular milk case run boxes definitely easier handle overall take less space refrigerator shape easier tuck amongst contents flip top also convenient note first open one pouring might chug bit pour air opening left spout end suppose could poke hole top somewhere alleviate find serious problem

Sadly the stores in my area don't carry it anymore so I had to buy it online. The reason I chose to buy this one was because there was not an outrageous shipping fee.

"The BabyComfyNose is better in many ways than a bulb syringe that you squeeze. I like that you can control how much you are sucking. I also really like that you can see what's coming out of your baby's nose. I like the mesh bag because the whole thing can air dry in it. The small bit that goes in the nostril and the bottom part that comes off the tube are very easy to clean, but the part with the tube is difficult to clean because if you get water in the tube, you have to try to blow the water out before using the apparatus again, otherwise you can't suck. My baby is not nearly as calm as the baby in the product video; in fact, he screams and tries to pull it away. It does help a lot if you use saline nose drops before trying to do this (as with any nasal aspirator) because it loosens the mucus and it makes it easier to suck out those boogers.

"1st cup down, second cup being enjoyed. My can says it expires 5/2011 - I have no idea how far out they set their best used by dates, so I've no idea how long this has been around. However, my first and second cup of coffee were flavorful and NOT bitter or sour. I paid next to nothing for this coffee and would again, but I wouldn't pay the nearly 8 dollars per can it is now when I paid a little more than that for 3 cans. It wasn't a knock your socks off, I can never drink another cup unless it's this cup of joe - but it's smooth, mellow, and enjoyable, especially when I paid next to nothing for it. If I'm going to pay nearly 8 bucks for a 1/2 pound, I'll go up to the local coffee roaster and get it fresh. (oh, normally I don't get my coffee in ground form, I usually grind it myself, but this was soooo inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.)Side note - this is an espresso grind. I had no trouble with it floating or clogging, but I sprinkled it with some cold water to wet the grinds a bit before I started the brewing, that helps keep them from floating up. I also propped open the little spring loaded cover to the coffee basket with a skewer so it was as open as it could get. Result was a clear coffee and no mess. Ratio - one level coffee scoop per cup as measured on the carafe.edit update 3/29/2011 - I've now had about 9 cans of this coffee - it's my go to coffee, it's still smooth mellow and enjoyable and I've given it an extra star for consistency, it's been good through all those cans, when ever it's on a decent sale (usually on the Friday Sale) I buy it again, just got another 3 cans.

"My daughter has been becoming more adventurous of late, so I've been looking for something to keep her out of the kitchen (and the trash). Money is tight, as it is for many parents, so I needed something that wouldn't hurt the wallet too much but would still do the job. The North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate largely gets the job done.Actually using the thing is tedious. It's easy to know how to use, but actually using it really does require two hands, especially it you have any kind of molding around the bottom of your doorways as I have in my kitchen (you have to hold it in place above the molding with one hand, while using the other to bring down the locking bar. The ""memory-lock"" feature might sound good in theory, but it just doesn't work as well as you think, as adjusting it often causes the memory bar to come undone.

"I've owned and used this product for some time now and am quite happy with it. I did notice that I had problems with an unpleasant humming introduced one time when using it with powered speakers, but I believe this was more so my fault than that of the unit. I learned that my active speakers did not care for input cables past a certain length. For greater distances, using a wireless transmitter to deliver the mixed sound and its matching wireless receiver connected to the speaker units solved this problem completely. The FX processor works flawlessly just as long as I remember to push down the selector to engage the desired function. Very easy to use. Compact in size. No ability to instantly mute an input device other than to turn down the gain. For the price ... what can you expect?!Soon I will be in the market for an upgrade ... one that has slider controls and the ability to connect to my laptop via usb.

Giving out 1-star ratings because you had a shipping issue or because some third party (like Fender) didn't get you the right model is unfortunate, but it has nothing to do with the product itself.

"I'm the first one to admit that I don't much like oatmeal unless it's steel cut, and that's usually best made the slow way.  That said, I thought the Quaker Cherry-Pistachio oatmeal sounded reasonably good, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Cherries, pistachios, almonds and whole grains?  What's not to like?And to be honest, the flavor was decent.  There was a generous proportion of both fruit and nuts in here.  It was a bit sweeter than I like but that's nothing new for me.  I made the mistake of assuming that the water from my Zojirushi water boiler would be hot enough at 195 degrees to prepare the cereal properly, but sadly that wasn't the case and I ended up with oatmeal soup with a lot of very chewy bits. That was entirely my own fault, but let it be a lesson to anyone else who doesn't boil up water fresh for stuff like this.  Nearly boiling isn't nearly hot enough for this stuff even if it is for tea.  Truth be told, I probably enjoyed it more a bit under-cooked since I really don't like the gluey quality of most rolled oats.So the bottom line here is this: If you like oatmeal with fruit and nuts and you don't have the time to make it, or you want something portable, this is a pretty good substitute for the real thing so long as you make sure your water is very hot.  However if you have the time, make your oatmeal from scratch and add exactly the amount of fruit, nuts and sweetener that you want.  You might try steel cut, too.  It's miles better.Still... you could do a lot worse than Quaker Real Medleys.",grocery,first one admit much like oatmeal unless steel cut usually best made slow way said thought quaker cherry pistachio oatmeal sounded reasonably good thought give try cherries pistachios almonds whole grains like honest flavor decent generous proportion fruit nuts bit sweeter like nothing new made mistake assuming water zojirushi water boiler would hot enough degrees prepare cereal properly sadly case ended oatmeal soup lot chewy bits entirely fault let lesson anyone else boil water fresh stuff like nearly boiling nearly hot enough stuff even tea truth told probably enjoyed bit cooked since really like gluey quality rolled oats bottom line like oatmeal fruit nuts time make want something portable pretty good substitute real thing long make sure water hot however time make oatmeal scratch add exactly amount fruit nuts sweetener want might try steel cut miles better still could lot worse quaker real medleys

"After years of spending so much money on expensive makeup (MAC, Clinique, Makeup Forever, etc.), I ended up at Ulta browsing the aisles for an inexpensive yet effective foundation when a makeup artist suggested the Maybelline Fit brand. It was inexpensive, I had a coupon, so I went for it. I loved the Maybelline Fit foundation and concealer. Color matching was not a problem because they have many shades to choose from. I only wore the foundation at night because I just don't like that heavy feeling during the day. Plus it still looked like I had makeup on even thought I wanted to look more natural. I then jumped on the BB Cream wagon because everyone was doing it and it supposedly gave you a more natural look. I hated using BB cream. I used the Mischa brand, and it felt like a heavy foundation and went on very dry. The Olay brand went on moist but did not cover as well. After some research and reading reviews by makeup artists, BB cream is not really necessary and is no more than a tinted moisturizer. I'm 40, so high SPF coverage is essential for me. I decided to do my own experiment. If you use a good SPF moisturizer and light foundation, then you get a better result that leaves your face A) protected highter than 15 or 20 SPF and B) thoroughly moisturized. So...here's what I decided to do. I continued to use my awesome moisturizer with high SPFNeutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with Helioplex, SPF 50, 1.7 Ouncesand amazing eye creamClarins Sun Care Cream High Protection SPF 30 for Sun-sensitive Skin, 4.40 Ounce(you can't find eye creams with high SPFs these days). Anyway, after applying both and letting them dry, I then apply my Maybelline Dream Matte foundation using a MAC Duo Fibre #187 brush for light and even coverage. Use a good brush! Go to the MAC site and see what it looks like, then buy something similar if you can't spend MAC money. Applying it with your fingers or a sponge is not enough to work it in evenly and lightly. Using the brush feels like I get more of an airbrushed effect. Also, I don't have to use powder over this because it's not greasy at all. I feel just right with the Dream Matte foundation over my face cream, but I still use the Maybelline Fit concealer in the tube because it works great and I need heavier coverage under my eyes to cover my circles. I've tossed all my BB creams and just stick with this routine. I've gotten a lot of compliments that I look ""fresh"" and natural. For this price point, just try it and see how you like it. It's better than spending $30-40 at the department stores.",beauty,years spending much money expensive makeup mac clinique makeup forever etc ended ulta browsing aisles inexpensive yet effective foundation makeup artist suggested maybelline fit brand inexpensive coupon went loved maybelline fit foundation concealer color matching problem many shades choose wore foundation night like heavy feeling day plus still looked like makeup even thought wanted look natural jumped bb cream wagon everyone supposedly gave natural look hated using bb cream used mischa brand felt like heavy foundation went dry olay brand went moist cover well research reading reviews makeup artists bb cream really necessary tinted moisturizer high spf coverage essential decided experiment use good spf moisturizer light foundation get better result leaves face protected highter spf b thoroughly moisturized decided continued use awesome moisturizer high spfneutrogena healthy defense daily moisturizer helioplex spf ouncesand amazing eye creamclarins sun care cream high protection spf sun sensitive skin ounce find eye creams high spfs days anyway applying letting dry apply maybelline dream matte foundation using mac duo fibre brush light even coverage use good brush go mac site see looks like buy something similar spend mac money applying fingers sponge enough work evenly lightly using brush feels like get airbrushed effect also use powder greasy feel right dream matte foundation face cream still use maybelline fit concealer tube works great need heavier coverage eyes cover circles tossed bb creams stick routine gotten lot compliments look fresh natural price point try see like better spending department stores

"Well this amp does have it's pros and cons, however the cons are overshadowed by the pros.Pros:1) Small!!!! 2) sounds like a big combo amp 3) makes overdrive pedals sound better 4) sustain 5) big bottom bass 6) HD construction and components. 7) I can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback. 8) it soundsREALLY good!Cons:1) yes, it ""could"" be louder 2) Not ""bright""Now the details,  I have a tube combo amp and in comparison the ZT is a bit on the dull side as far as presence.Its not that it does not have it, just could use more. However this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion. Solos just sing on this amp.  I feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better. The ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way.  I stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good. I also kinda detect some what of a processed chorusy sound plugged straight in when I first turn it on (seems to go away). I know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally. It also seems to have a positive compression/pumping release that make the notes sing and get louder as they ring.Volume?  For a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill. Mic'ing for larger venues would work just fine.If you're in a LOUD band, you might consider plugging in an external cabinet as it does have that option. (darn I meant to test before this review). TIP- so on youtube and some other forums guys are making the amp louder by plugging a blank cord into the1/8"" aux input on the back. I tested this and yes, it does go louder for whatever the reason. (I'll be getting a blank 1/8""jack to put it that aux port) A small but very noticeable volume increase. If you need to be LOUDER then I suggest the larger ZT, but its double the price. A friend of mine has one and he no longer uses his mesa boogie or marshall amps anymore. The 12 club ZT is super loud.I can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback.1-100 I rate this a 98% gear head satisfaction. Remember we are talking about a lunchbox with a 6.5"" speakera tremendous feat of technology to get that much sound out of a little box.Check it out the reviews on youtube.PART II -Ok, the extension cabinet option: Hooked up a 8 ohm cab and it sounded bigger and louder. However do NOT use the internal speaker together with the extension cabinet - Turn the switch off. It WILL overheat the amp and start acting weird. I found out the hard way, verified with the manual that you should shut off the internal speaker. I would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both.

"After years of soldering connectors to custom wire lengths, I love the ease of buying a few packs of inexpensive patch cords and just plugging in. Some of my older pedals are still connected using soldered 90 degree plugs that invite crackle and hum over time - may be due to vibration when packing / setting up or, maybe it's just contaminates in the air condensing on the contact surface. No matter, I won't be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again.One advantage of these molded plugs is smaller size - especially when connecting stereo devices. Much narrower than the 90 degree metal shells with screws. A couple of concerns I had were increased noise without the metal connector shell and the restrictions of fixed length. As it turns out, they don't contribute to higher noise levels and, they are just the right length for all my pedal connections. Everything is connected using this single length patch.Love the color coding, too. Especially on the stereo pedals connected in series where you can link the mono and B channels and are looking for that mono output in less than bright light.And what to do if one does fail? Toss it and grab another from the bag of patch cords that cost less than a couple of soldered connectors and is replaced faster than a soldering iron can get up to temperature.

"I own the Behringer Xenyx 1202FX, which is essentially this model but costs about 20 dollars more for the FX (it comes with 100 set effects). I have been doing home recording with Cubase and Logic, using a Presonus Firebox audio interface, with both MIDI, vocals and instruments, and didn't use a mixing board, but eventually decided to try one out given that (a) they are making them at very reasonable prices and (b) I had more inputs and outputs than the Firebox could easily handle.This mixing board didn't look that impressive to me when I first checked it out, but having set it up and used it, it operates very well and cleanly. The fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus. The fact that it does not have an on/off switch is a minus. But basically it works well, the EQ is useful, and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer. Behringer makes a range of models with less/more inputs to suit one's needs, so this is great. Also, having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me, as I can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what I want to record. Another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether -- you have to turn it down to zero. And, there are no faders (except the main); instead it uses knobs for everything. Well, I would have liked some of these things, but then I would have to pay more, and what I really wanted was functionality at a good price, and that is what the Behringer Xenyx has delivered thus far.By the way, I am running the following through the mixer: an AT3035 audiotechnica condenser mic, an Alesis QS8.1, guitar via line-in (or mic'd), two KRK RP5 studio monitors, Presonus Firebox.

"I have 3 different tweezers and other products by Tweezerman. Tweezerman makes great products, and stands by their products. You can get your tweezers re-sharpened for free for a lifetime! Anyhow, this particular eye lash curler is quite nice because it comes with 3 non-stick silicone pads, while competitor products will usually only come with one, if any. With that said, this eyelash curler is a good value at this price point. The curler is also ergonomic, just like all their other products. I have yet to be disappointed by Tweezerman, so I recommend any of their products to my friends and family.

"There isn&#8217;t anything wrong with these. They are easy to fill and do stand well. Like most breast milk storage bags, the measurement lines are in oz and ml. The lines are meant to be a guide. Because the bag is, well&#8230; a bag, the measurement will change depending on how the bad is sitting. I was able to get the ml to match up with what I poured in the bad, but not necessarily at the most natural standing position. This shouldn&#8217;t really be a concern, however, because this is generally the case for just about every brand of storage bags I have tried.The most important thing to me in a storage bag is how they freeze. I freeze my bags lying flat so they are easy to store. I want to be able to stack and store them easily in the freezer. For Fiona, I had over 100 bags in the freezer, and little milk bags add up to a lot of storage space. These bags do not go flat and do not stack well. They take up more room than my favorite brand,Lansinoh. If you are freezing a few bags, it is not a big deal, but when you are stock piling milk for when you go back to work, fitting 20-30% more in a box can make a big difference in freezer space.",baby,anything wrong easy fill stand well like breast milk storage bags measurement lines oz ml lines meant guide bag well bag measurement change depending bad sitting able get ml match poured bad necessarily natural standing position really concern however generally case every brand storage bags tried important thing storage bag freeze freeze bags lying flat easy store want able stack store easily freezer fiona bags freezer little milk bags add lot storage space bags go flat stack well take room favorite brand lansinoh freezing bags big deal stock piling milk go back work fitting box make big difference freezer space

"I picked up this Behringer CT100 cable tester because it takes the guesswork out of maintaining a cable collection. The unit does its job very well and it helped me find several bad cables that I previously thought were ok. It is well built and sturdy. The bottom of the tester has sharp metal corners and screws that could damage a wooden table. I suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside.Although the machine itself is good, the accompanying documentation is awful. It presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack. For example, it does not include illustrations of how the LCD readout should look when a cable is good or bad.

"Think of this as an artist's tool.  And for every job there is the 'right' tool.  Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles.  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.  But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise.  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It it doesn't make sense, there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger.  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it.  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp.",music,think artist tool every job right tool best distortion pedal really depends sound trying get gear technique using using bad gear poor technique perform miracles make watt solid state ibanez soundblaster amp sound like raging orange rockerverb make single coils sound like emg arguing pedal best like two painters arguing color best used paint sunrise pedal good tight kind distortion heavy modern metal running clean amp makes sense make sense ample youtube reviews check pulling trigger used professional players like steve vai joe satriani kurt cobain professional pedal used professional musicians built like brick durable get found mine used new asking price fair would like see boss start using true bypass instead buffered bypass use admittedly detect tonesuck run mine tube amp verge breakup really get things cooking also takes overdrive sustainer pretty well bump gain get singing leads exception modeler type pedals companies like tech think dirtboxes included perform optimally run solid state amp happy way distorting marshall mg problem amp

"The Korg Pitchblack is probably, along with the BOSS TU-2/TU-3, considered one of the industry standards for compact pedal bypass tuners for use with guitar and bass.  Both the TU-2 and Pitchblack are excellent, and I don't really have an opinion yet as to which is better.  However, there are some strengths of the Korg Pitchblack that may lead you to prefer it over other tuners.  The primary draw here is the bright light-up display with wide color bars.  The tuner displays the note you are closest to, and the colors guide you to the perfect pitch, marked by the green light in the middle (almost like an airplane landing guide).  But not only do the lights indicate tone by turning on and off, they actually dim and transition into one another as you go across those semi-tones.  You could argue, therefore, that the visual guide is giving you a lot more precision than you would get from a simple on/off light.  The tuner works quickly and reliably.The build quality is outstanding, and it's true bypass.  When you step on the pedal, the tuner is on and the guitar signal is off.  The switch is also of the ""soft button"" variety, similar to what you find on some Vox pedals and many boutiques.  It has a nice feel to it, though it could be easier to bump if it's in a high traffic area.This is a great tuner at a reasonable price.  It really comes down to user preference, but I've heard many guitarists prefer this one because of its high accuracy and visibility.",music,korg pitchblack probably along boss tu tu considered one industry standards compact pedal bypass tuners use guitar bass tu pitchblack excellent really opinion yet better however strengths korg pitchblack may lead prefer tuners primary draw bright light display wide color bars tuner displays note closest colors guide perfect pitch marked green light middle almost like airplane landing guide lights indicate tone turning actually dim transition one another go across semi tones could argue therefore visual guide giving lot precision would get simple light tuner works quickly reliably build quality outstanding true bypass step pedal tuner guitar signal switch also soft button variety similar find vox pedals many boutiques nice feel though could easier bump high traffic area great tuner reasonable price really comes user preference heard many guitarists prefer one high accuracy visibility

"SOUND QUALITY: The BX5 sounds neutral and balanced. Compared to similar sized consumer speakers, they are a bit understated and without bass bloat or exaggerated highs (i.e., teen EQ). The even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours. It also lacks a midrange bump, and sounds a bit recessed or laid-back compared to average earbuds or home speakers. In fact the BX5 sounds similar to my Sennheiser 580HD headphones, but with less lower bass. And that's a good thing for mixing as you don't want speakers that add color and/or bumps in the frequency response.Unlike typical passive stereo speakers, the BX5 is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer, i.e., bi-amped. This design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver. The downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables, so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editing.At first the BX5 struck me as underpowered for a 70 watt rating, at least with a signal directly from my Mac Pro. However, once jacked into the hotter signal from my MOTU Ultralite the true power of the BX5 was revealed. It was loud and could be painfully so if cranked.These are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out (your head should form a triangle with the two speakers). That diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is MIA. In fact, unlike most speakers, there is little rearwards projection. Perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties. So don't buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use.I mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings, live and multitrack, so the bass range is perfect for me. The bass extends down to a clear 60Hz, so plenty ump for drop-D and drop-C tuning. If you mix bass guitar and kick drum you'll want larger speakers (BX8) or a sub but these are great for guitar.I'm used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass, mid and highs for different room responses and taste. Oddly, the PDF instructions show EQ switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers. I assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure.RFI RESISTANCE: I'm an inner city dweller and live in a high RFI area. Cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes. So one of the major selling points for me was M-Audio's claim of RFI shielding. Luckily that was no mere marketing jive. They really are well shielded against RFI. Not a single wayward drum loop or DJ in my tracks, not even when cranked. I can't make that claim for prior speakers I've owned.HEAT: These speakers run on the warm side: the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session. Not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips. It has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat. However I have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions. I live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up. Not a deal breaker but it's wise to turn them off when not in use (I use a power strip so I don't have to flip two separate switches).CONSTRUCTION: These are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way: the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed Cinema Display and MOTU Ultralite. Construction appears very good with dense particle board (MDF) cabs, metal back plate (heat sink benefit) and matching plastic front molding around the drivers. The cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl. These monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driver.The bass drivers are Kevlar with rubber surrounds (tougher than foam!) and the tweeters sport silk domes. No protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors. So the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick.CONNECTIONS: Like most studio monitors, the BX5 comes with pro audio style jacks for 1/4 inch phone plug/TRS and XLR. If you're a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use, be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks, RCA or USB. So you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters. If you're an experienced recordist, you should have plenty of these cables laying around but, otherwise, be prepared to reach for your wallet.One of the things I like about the BX5 is both the TRS and XLR connections are active at the same time, allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches. I have an Audioengine D1 DAC connected to the TRS/phone input (for iTunes, movies, games, etc.) while a MOTU Ultralite (for mixing & tracking) is plugged into the XLR connection.LAST BLURB: Yes, the small Focal speakers I listened to were better sounding and louder than the BX5 but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches. However, a perfect monitor for a home studio isn't only about a good neutral sound, but also about compactness, appearance and value. And the BX5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine.",music,sound quality bx sounds neutral balanced compared similar sized consumer speakers bit understated without bass bloat exaggerated highs e teen eq even keeled tonal signature pleasing easy listen hours also lacks midrange bump sounds bit recessed laid back compared average earbuds home speakers fact bx sounds similar sennheiser hd headphones less lower bass good thing mixing want speakers add color bumps frequency response unlike typical passive stereo speakers bx powered separate amplifiers tweeter woofer e bi amped design allows accurate reproduction amplifiers optimized driver downside design speaker needs input power cables convenient living room use problem nearfield computer based editing first bx struck underpowered watt rating least signal directly mac pro however jacked hotter signal motu ultralite true power bx revealed loud could painfully cranked directional speakers render placement instruments stereo soundfield accurately long sit sweet spot couple feet head form triangle two speakers diffuse room filling tone home theatre speakers mia fact unlike speakers little rearwards projection perfect bothering family neighbors bad parties buy standard stereo home theatre use mainly mix classical acoustic guitar solo ensemble recordings live multitrack bass range perfect bass extends clear hz plenty ump drop drop c tuning mix bass guitar kick drum want larger speakers bx sub great guitar used mixing neutral speakers headphones would nice could adjust bass mid highs different room responses taste oddly pdf instructions show eq switches prior version model missing speakers assume omitted cost cutting measure rfi resistance inner city dweller live high rfi area cheap audio gear acts like radio receiver injects local classic rock station mixes one major selling points audio claim rfi shielding luckily mere marketing jive really well shielded rfi single wayward drum loop dj tracks even cranked make claim prior speakers owned heat speakers run warm side upper back fairly warm idling get hot touch long session egg frying hot wee bit uncomfortable fingertips sensor shut case excessive heat however seen shutdown even day editing sessions live balmy tropics cold weather dwellers may see much heat build deal breaker wise turn use use power strip flip two separate switches construction handsome units blend gear sort way black finish matches perfectly black trimmed cinema display motu ultralite construction appears good dense particle board mdf cabs metal back plate heat sink benefit matching plastic front molding around drivers cabs covered satin black vinyl monitors petite smaller speakers sized bass driver bass drivers kevlar rubber surrounds tougher foam tweeters sport silk domes protective grill covers usual mixing monitors nekid drivers easily damaged careless finger chopstick connections like studio monitors bx comes pro audio style jacks inch phone plug trs xlr novice recordist civilian buying general computer use forewarned stereo mini jacks rca usb need pay extra set special cables adapters experienced recordist plenty cables laying around otherwise prepared reach wallet one things like bx trs xlr connections active time allowing monitors receive signals two different sources without messing cables switches audioengine dac connected trs phone input itunes movies games etc motu ultralite mixing tracking plugged xlr connection last blurb yes small focal speakers listened better sounding louder bx cost couple toes month lunches however perfect monitor home studio good neutral sound also compactness appearance value bx nails still sounding pretty dad burn fine
Great unit for the price. It offer a lot of variations in echo delay types.It is sturdy enough for my use as not a stage piece. Even so would nothesitate to use that way. I can't say what battery life is as only use withan AC adapter. The EM600 sounds great using outputs to 2 differentamps. I drive mine sometimes with the Behringer A/B box using one ofthe 2 pre-amp gain controls or the Behringer Tube Amp Modeler.Only downside is the settings type control for echo delay types is a bithard to read without getting close to it especially in dim lighting.This isn't really a big deal though and often don't put the EM600 on the floor..,music,great unit price offer lot variations echo delay types sturdy enough use stage piece even would nothesitate use way say battery life use withan ac adapter em sounds great using outputs differentamps drive mine sometimes behringer b box using one ofthe pre amp gain controls behringer tube amp modeler downside settings type control echo delay types bithard read without getting close especially dim lighting really big deal though often put em floor

"When my daughter started to bounce while standing on our laps, we knew we needed to get her a jumper! I did a lot of research on the different jumpers out there and read a ton of reviews on Amazon and made the perfect decision of getting this item. My daughter has been a jumping queen for the past month since we got the jumperoo. My husband assembled the jumper in less than 15 minutes and I took 5 minutes to clean the plastic parts on the jumper and she was in the jumper. Because she was 3 months (24 inches) at the time, she was alittle short to reach the ground (even at the lowest setting) so we just placed a pillow on the floor and that gave her enough leverage to jump away. She is also starting to play with the different toys around the jumper which is so cool to see. All of the toys are easy to clean and even the toy that serves as a teether is easily able to go in the dishwasher for cleaning. Oh and my daughter loves that the chair rotates around so that she can play with the different toys around the jumper. She also likes the gecko and bird that hang over her. And the chair cover is also easy to clean by removing it and placing it in the washer. Awesome jumper! Don't know what we would do without it!

"I was skeptical about all the hype surrounding the Ergo and resisted getting one because it seemed pricey. But after trying on an Ergo at a store and comparing it to the other carriers I'd used, I was sold. It is the most comfortable and supportive carrier I've tried. I liked the look of the sporty Ergo models but after reading reviews that the shoulder straps weren't as padded I went with the 'original' model, because for me comfort is the main thing. I think the original might be hotter in the summer than the sport models, because the fabric is different. For me that's not an issue, I don't get overheated easily. But if I lived in a really hot climate I might order both types and try both out to see which I liked better.I was concerned that my baby would resist facing inward, because she was used to facing out, and the Ergo does not have that position. But it hasn't been a problem at all. She has plenty of space to turn her head from side to side and see what's going on, and I think she likes being able to put her head on my chest when she's tired or when there's too much stimuli. It's actually much more snuggly, and I think we both prefer it. Some times the only way I can get her to fall asleep when she's really fussy is to put her in the Ergo and walk on our treadmill (this is handy when it's cold outside) and she settles right down and drifts off. The Ergo is easy for me to unsnap and then I can lay her down without waking her.I like the pocket on the front, it's very roomy. I also like the sleeping hood and how it snaps to the shoulder straps. It provides head support and a little bit of a cocoon for the baby, although there's still spaces on the sides of the carrier to provide plenty of air circulation. Mainly though I just like that it is so COMFORTABLE for my back and my shoulders. I can carry the baby all day in this, and I do.*Update*I've used this carrier pretty much on a daily basis since buying it months ago and if I could only have one item of baby gear I would choose this over a stroller, baby swing, jumperoo, bouncer, even a crib any day. It's the ONE item we bought that has continued to be useful over time and it's the ONE thing my baby hasn't grown tired of. It's invaluable when traveling and even just going to the store. I've also found that if my baby is fighting a nap I can put her in it and vacuum for a while and she falls asleep. Still comfortable for my back as she gets bigger.

However, the crib is exactly the color that is in the picture. I really shouldn't have been so surprised, since it is exactly as pictured.)Also, the mattress support on this crib is not like that of a traditional crib. I was a little disappointed in that, because the mattress support does not seem very substantial and I am pretty sure it won't hold up as well as a traditional size crib.

It does blow very hot air, something I need because my hair is VERY long (to my waist) and pretty thick too.The issue I have with this dryer is that it has an auto-cool on it, meaning it will blow super hot air on high for about 20-30 seconds and then it cuts down to half the power in heat and air. Meaning that I'm spending MORE time trying to dry my hair! I realize they put this feature on it to help keep the dryer from overheating and thus shutting off completely. As anyone with long or thick  hair has probably experienced with a hair dryer before, if you continually use the high setting it can over heat and just shut off...then you're left standing there either blowing into the fan or swinging it with your arm to get cool air into the unit to cool it off so the dryer kicks back on again. So while the concept of the overheat prevention is a good idea, allowing the hair dryer to blow on medium and cooler air to prevent an overheat, it's BAD news if you're trying to dry your hair! It doesn't heat up for mins before it does this...it happens within the first 20-30 seconds into drying. It's a WASTE of my time! I didn't buy this hair dryer to stand in my bathrooom for almost an hour to try and dry my hair. I hate this dryer because of this issue. I want a dryer that gives me constant heat on HIGH like I NEED.I'll be looking for something else I suppose.",beauty,impressed hair dryer like smaller unit also travel ready like small size fold away handle makes packing travel easy however problem performance hair dryer blow hot air something need hair long waist pretty thick issue dryer auto cool meaning blow super hot air high seconds cuts half power heat air meaning spending time trying dry hair realize put feature help keep dryer overheating thus shutting completely anyone long thick hair probably experienced hair dryer continually use high setting heat shut left standing either blowing fan swinging arm get cool air unit cool dryer kicks back concept overheat prevention good idea allowing hair dryer blow medium cooler air prevent overheat bad news trying dry hair heat mins happens within first seconds drying waste time buy hair dryer stand bathrooom almost hour try dry hair hate dryer issue want dryer gives constant heat high like need looking something else suppose

"i got another activity gym before i got this one.  with the other one, my 2 months old baby just lay there and wouldn't be interested remotely to reach out or even look at the toys hanging above him.  with this activity gum, he actually like the owl enough, not only to look at it, but reaching out for it.  i think part of it was because of the sound from inside of the toy.  (another toy in this set has little balls inside the plastic stomach that makes sound too, but very low faint sound that my baby doesn't care for).  we call him mr. owl now and it's still the only toy my baby likes.  we no longer hang it on the bar now, since i want to use mr owl to grab my baby's attention for tummy time and help him look up by lifting his head.  my baby also have a strong (very strong) preference for the right side, so when i could, i would hold mr. owl on this left size when he's sitting at his glider chair so he would look to the left longer.  of course it doesn't work all day long, but it's better than just me sitting on his left or having tv to his left side.another thing i like about this one is for the tummy time cushion.  it's much better than using a roll-up blanket.  at least my baby could tolerate this for longer in comparison.",baby,got another activity gym got one one months old baby lay interested remotely reach even look toys hanging activity gum actually like owl enough look reaching think part sound inside toy another toy set little balls inside plastic stomach makes sound low faint sound baby care call mr owl still toy baby likes longer hang bar since want use mr owl grab baby attention tummy time help look lifting head baby also strong strong preference right side could would hold mr owl left size sitting glider chair would look left longer course work day long better sitting left tv left side another thing like one tummy time cushion much better using roll blanket least baby could tolerate longer comparison

"Just got my stand today... the QUICKEST delivery EVER with the Super Savings free shipping selected that I have ever experienced!  Go go, Amazon!  lulz  Anyhoo, I have two banjos and a mandolin that I purchased this for.  I looked about for quite a bit at various sites, reviews, prices, etc, and pretty much Hercules got the best reviews everywhere (although admittedly I hadn't really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars).  Yet this tri-stand really looked good with a solid general review, and I am rather tight for space overall (think trailer home size).  I wanted a way to hold my instruments in one place without having to work around gig-bags or hard cases taking up limited 'living space'. As it stands (figuratively and literally), the Hercules Tri-Stand does the job excellently with the two banjos.  All three instruments are varying heights, the resonator bluegrass banjo being the longest, and (naturally) the mandolin being the shortest, with a open back clawhammer banjo in the middle.The three 'back-rest' fold outs are static, attached to a center ring, and you ""can"" adjust them independently a *little up and down*, but not to compensate for such a length difference between a bluegrass banjo and a mandolin.  However, the mandolin is a really lite thing, so I suspect it will be fine just hanging there by the peg head without a 'back-rest' as long as the stand isn't jostled around.  In my own case, aside from two rather lazy cats and pending no sudden hip-smash-oops by me, that shouldn't be an issue.  And of course, considering I am looking at a possible third banjo, the mandolin may just go live in its case after all...Now a word about open back banjos, if you are considering this stand... First off, no, I was not going to rest the coordinator rod against the 'back-rest' (just seems like a bad idea).  What I ended up doing was adjusting the 'back-rests' so the resonator of the bluegrass banjo rested about an inch up from the bottom, allowing the open back to rest on the other side ON TOP of the rest, along the lip of the banjo rim, at the edge of the rest foam where it begins to curve out and down. The tail-piece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing.  Seems pretty solid in this position while still engaging the weight clamps up at the top.I give it 5 stars mainly based on the excellent quality of the stand and the fact that it is the ONLY three instrument stand worth any kind of hoot I have been able to find.  Its not the absolute perfect thing for my own application (would need the three 'back-rests' to be independently adjustable in height for that), but overall I am extremely pleased with it.",music,got stand today quickest delivery ever super savings free shipping selected ever experienced go go amazon lulz anyhoo two banjos mandolin purchased looked quite bit various sites reviews prices etc pretty much hercules got best reviews everywhere although admittedly really wanted shell dollars yet tri stand really looked good solid general review rather tight space overall think trailer home size wanted way hold instruments one place without work around gig bags hard cases taking limited living space stands figuratively literally hercules tri stand job excellently two banjos three instruments varying heights resonator bluegrass banjo longest naturally mandolin shortest open back clawhammer banjo middle three back rest fold outs static attached center ring adjust independently little compensate length difference bluegrass banjo mandolin however mandolin really lite thing suspect fine hanging peg head without back rest long stand jostled around case aside two rather lazy cats pending sudden hip smash oops issue course considering looking possible third banjo mandolin may go live case word open back banjos considering stand first going rest coordinator rod back rest seems like bad idea ended adjusting back rests resonator bluegrass banjo rested inch bottom allowing open back rest side top rest along lip banjo rim edge rest foam begins curve tail piece nut two foam pads without touching thing seems pretty solid position still engaging weight clamps top give stars mainly based excellent quality stand fact three instrument stand worth kind hoot able find absolute perfect thing application would need three back rests independently adjustable height overall extremely pleased
"I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips. I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp. The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming. I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol. They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked. They use heat and pressure to &#34;pop&#34; the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.Finally, these packages have a &#34;use by&#34; date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.",grocery,big fan sea salt vinegar chips daughter decided surprise new popchips really like different texture light tender crisp salt vinegar taste strong tangy overwhelming like individual packages actually stop eating finish bag bag large chips grams fat bad calories g carbohydrates mg salt cholesterol vegan friendly parve meat dairy gluten free package says healthier fried tastier baked use heat pressure pop potatoes light airy description chips finally packages use date nearly year much longer regular chips

"I tend to favor fruit desserts and cookies and cakes over chocolate, so be aware of that as you read this review. I like Fig Newtons and all the different fruit Newtons, but I wasn't sure what to expect in these cookies. I was pleasantly surprised.Unlike Newtons, these cookies are very light and crispy. They're a bit delicate, and they broke easily, which is probably why they're packaged in plastic trays in the bag as opposed to simply being free roaming in the bag. I think if I were to put them in a ziplok bag, they'd all break into pieces. Not the sturdiest of cookies, but very delicately crispy.The flavor is good. There are bits of cranberries that aren't too big nor too small. The package says ""citrus"" and there are pictures of oranges on the front, but I thought these tasted more lemony than orangey. I think I would have liked more cranberry flavor and less lemon flavor. The cookie was also not too sweet, which I tend to like better. This was definitely less sweet than a chocolate chip cookie.The texture is nutty and you can definitely taste the whole grains and fiber, which I like, but which other people may not care for. It's also a drier cookie, not as oily as normal chocolate chip cookies bought at the store or on the grocery shelves.

"Bought this as a supplement to my other amps (to record blues tones).  I first saw it in a big box musician's store while there was a ""blues guitar session"" going which is a public jam session open to anyone.  They had a lot of tube Fender amps plugged in.  I was surprised when I plugged into this amp away from that group, turned it up, and started playing... It sounded just as good as those other amps.  The two employees that worked there and two other customers couldn't believe where the sound was coming from... even the other players checked it out.

"A few weeks ago I spent $42 to buy the MAC 187, my first ever MAC brush. I don't use MAC cosmetics because they're made with lead & other toxins, but nearly everyone online raves about how their line is the Rolls Royce of make-up brushes, they last forever, yadda-yadda. So I thought I'd buy a MAC brush. I've been using Real Techniques Stippling brush for about a year now with good results, but I always thought the brush head is a bit skimpy & the handle isn't wel designed. The bristles are rather short & there could be more of them. But I give Real Techniques full marks because their Stippling brush works well, has held together for more than a year & it never, ever sheds. My new MAC brush sheds like a cheap fur coat every time I use it, even after repeated cleanings! (I guess that's because the bristles are a combo of natural & synthetic hairs...?) But my Sigma F-50 arrived today & it works like a charm! The handle is about 3/4 in. longer than the MAC, which I prefer because I have long fingers. The bristles are not quite as dense as the MAC but they're slightly softer & silkier. The Sigma gave me a beautiful, air-brushed finish And Didn't Shed A Single Hair! :) So my overpriced MAC brush is going in the bathroom drawer as a back-up tool. Wish I'd saved the receipt so I could return it. Some women say brush shedding is no big deal, they just pick the hairs off their face. But after spending the time to apply a flawless foundation, I hate picking brush hairs off my skin! Assuming it holds up over time, the Sigma F50 will be the last stippling brush you'll ever need.

"I had the Behringer DR 600 (Ultra Reverb), but was unhappy with its tone and limited selection of reverb sounds. Although this unit is only $10 more, the difference in sound and tone may as well be $100 difference in quality of sound. That is, this one really sounds super once you adjust it to your own preferences. It may not have every reverb sound, but it has a nice selection, and they cover an impressive range, as well as giving you the option of &#34;wet&#34; (full) or &#34;dry&#34; (tinny) sounds and a &#34;trails&#34; that essentially adds some sustain. There's also an &#34;echo&#34; setting, but it's not very pronounced, though it does add an &#34;echo-like&#34; sound.So, my complaints are not with the quality of the machine or the range of effects or their qualities.There are a couple of annoying inconveniences. One is the BRIGHT blue light (indicating &#34;on&#34;). This has been commented on before. I have an array of pedals and this one is as bright as all the others combined. When it's on, you can't read the dials because of the glare in your eyes. I did find a solution. I put dark nail polish over the LED bulb. I had to put it on and wait for it to dry and reapply several times to get the dimming I desired.The second annoyance is that the name of the pedal is in black letters against a dark blue pedal color. This is impossible to read in stage (or even dim room) lighting. Of course, you can &#34;remember&#34; where it is or which one it is, but my other Behringer pedals all have white lettering, making them much easier to read. Every B. pedal has its own distinctive color, so that helps. My solution to this little dilemma was to buy some 1/4&#34; white vinyl letters from Office Depot and put them over the words &#34;REVERB&#34; on the pedal.It was annoying to have to make these cosmetic changes, but now I'm much happier with the pedal and can enjoy its sound instead of focusing on these minor irritations.",music,behringer dr ultra reverb unhappy tone limited selection reverb sounds although unit difference sound tone may well difference quality sound one really sounds super adjust preferences may every reverb sound nice selection cover impressive range well giving option wet full dry tinny sounds trails essentially adds sustain also echo setting pronounced though add echo like sound complaints quality machine range effects qualities couple annoying inconveniences one bright blue light indicating commented array pedals one bright others combined read dials glare eyes find solution put dark nail polish led bulb put wait dry reapply several times get dimming desired second annoyance name pedal black letters dark blue pedal color impossible read stage even dim room lighting course remember one behringer pedals white lettering making much easier read every b pedal distinctive color helps solution little dilemma buy white vinyl letters office depot put words reverb pedal annoying make cosmetic changes much happier pedal enjoy sound instead focusing minor irritations
"I used Loreal Dark Golden Brown which I've went dark before but not with Loreal.  First off buy a better brand.  Nice and Easy has worked better for me in the past.  Dyed my hair 4 days ago along with my daughters hair which was a dirty blonde.  Both of us had the same problem it went a darker red hers more lighter than mine but mine was dark brown with dark red hightlights and more light red at the roots.  I was not happy.  I did a lot of research yesterday with the Ardell Unred and Ardell Red Gold Correcter Plus trying to see the difference and maybe what it would do for me.  I said why not and went to the local Sallys Beauty Supply and bought both products.  (You can't get the .25 bottle of unred at Sallys just the packets).So last night I added 1 packet of unred to about 2 ounces of my conditioner for color treated hair after I shampooed hair so my hair was pretty wet when i applied.  I let it set 30 minutes and then rinsed it out.  Although my hair was still wet when I went to bed it didn't look much different.  This morning I woke up and decided to try the Ardell Red Gold Correcter Plus.  I used a 3 minute deep conditioner (3oz or so) with about 30 drops of the correcter and I put it on my DRY hair with just a touch of water to get it smoothed through. I let it set 30 minutes, rinsed it out, dryed it and straightened it.  AND I CAN tell a difference.  It looks less red and less brassy and more ashy.  I think if your using this stuff (either one) as a correcter instead of adding it to your dye then it will take some time and more than one treatment.  I am thinking that the red gold corrector worked a little better but it doesn't hurt to try both.",beauty,used loreal dark golden brown went dark loreal first buy better brand nice easy worked better past dyed hair days ago along daughters hair dirty blonde us problem went darker red lighter mine mine dark brown dark red hightlights light red roots happy lot research yesterday ardell unred ardell red gold correcter plus trying see difference maybe would said went local sallys beauty supply bought products get bottle unred sallys packets last night added packet unred ounces conditioner color treated hair shampooed hair hair pretty wet applied let set minutes rinsed although hair still wet went bed look much different morning woke decided try ardell red gold correcter plus used minute deep conditioner oz drops correcter put dry hair touch water get smoothed let set minutes rinsed dryed straightened tell difference looks less red less brassy ashy think using stuff either one correcter instead adding dye take time one treatment thinking red gold corrector worked little better hurt try
"That's my first attempt try cut oats (rather than rolled). The order was delivered (by Amazon) quickly and undamaged, all's good. I combined it with sunflower seeds to get free shipping. The stuff is a bit different from the rolled oats I'm used to: if you try them raw, they're not tasty at all (rolled are quite pleasant: I used to mix them with yogurt and eat w/o cooking; these cut oats, otoh, raw taste like nothing, like dry cardboard). But if you cook them, it's another story: the consistency is less like glue, they're chewier and have a bit of a nutty flavour -- goes great with sunflower seeds, which I've recently discovered and put them now in the oatmeal all the time; it's a great combination, almost crunchy.One thing you need to know is that the cooking directions on the box are really incorrect: it says 2-to-1 water; bring to boil; then simmer 10-12 mins. Unless I'm doing something wrong, you'll need more water, and you'll have to simmer at least twice as long. Also, the box says a serving is a quarter cup. Come on. If you're bird, that's a serving, yes. Not being a bird, I like a big bowl of this stuff, six to eight heaped tablespoons of it dry; that's nearly 3/4 of a cup, I think -- and half the pot of water. If it still has water when ready, it's better than the opposite (burned and stuck to the walls: tastes bad plus a lot of homework cleaning the pot); and if this extra-wet condition happens, I simply turn it off and let it sit a while: it sucks in the rest of water itself, w/o cooking. 'course you can't do it all in five minutes, so I do it well ahead of time. It's not an instanteneous product: you gotta have some half an hour before you eat it.But all right: what matters is whether the stuff is good, and it is (if I discover otherwise, I'll post an update to this review). When my new stash runs out, I'll reorder, so this will be a long-term record.Added on 07/18/2011: Even though I did mention above that this is not an instant product, I underestimated the length of time required to prepare it well: it's much longer than I thought. You _can_ get it to the typical glueey consistency with an awful lot of water absorption, but it literally takes hours to get it to that state.

"I'm a big fan of hot teas, and have sampled quite a few from the Lipton Herbal family. Nine times out of ten, the flavor of the tea sounds a lot more delicious in theory than in the tea itself. I find the process rather hit or miss when discovering what works and what doesn't quite satisfy. Now I love orange flavored tea (Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Orange Spice has been a long time favorite) and I thought the hint of hibiscus would be a nice complement.  So I was happy to give this brew a try.Did I enjoy the tea? I thought it was fine, warm and soothing.Does the flavor combination work? Well, that's the thing. While I did enjoy the tea, I'm not sure it presents itself quite as distinctly as it should in terms of flavor profile. If you were doing a blind taste test, I think you'd be hard pressed to identify either orange of hibiscus.  This is particularly odd as the tea itself advertises that it is made with real pieces of orange!My recommendation: Try to sample one before buying in bulk. Of course, this is the recommendation I'd use for just about ANY flavored tea! My favorites never tend to be the ones I'd thought they'd be! But still, I liked this one fine but I wouldn't seek it out again.  And the pyramid-shaped bags are cool as well.

"Hands down, this is the best foundation for my face. Everything I've tried has either caused me to breakout, or it's stuck to my dry areas and made me look like I had scales. This foundation doesn't do either. Another plus, it's one of very few foundations that actually matches my skin color. (Very pale, I'm using the Alabaster shade.)Easy easy easy to put this foundation on, because it goes on very much like a lotion. I just dab it around on my face and then rub it around with my fingers. Coverage is light, it's enough to make a small pimple not so obvious, but if you're trying to hide scars or angry red pimples, you'll need concealer under it.The only reason I've taken off 1 star is because it's got no form of oil control in it. Because I've got oily skin, this is a slight problem for me. No big deal really, because I just put some oil-control setting powder underneath it.

"Nice little acoustic amplifier that gets the job done with high fidelity and sufficient volume.  Numerous reviews posted on Amazon, Sweetwater Sound, and Musician's Friend pages and the positive ones pretty much all hit the mark.  This is 60W mini-PA that amplifies your guitar nicely and reproduces vocals beautifully- if you have a quality mic.  There are 'package' sets with this amp by other sellers on Amazon that bundle cables and mics, et cetera... recommend steering away from that and just buying the amp from Amazon and getting a Shure SM58 (or other quality mic) seperately.Many reviews talk about the durability and how easy the amp is to ding and scratch cosmetically.  I see potential for that, too- thus the need for a carry bag mentioned below.  But I don't see this as a big downer and I personally don't mind if it takes on a road worn appeareance after bumping it a few times.  If appearance is your thing, shell out the extra $200 and buy a Roland or Fender...Shop around... click around... if you buy &#34;items sold from Amazon&#34; you can depend on Free Shipping.  If you buy from sellers THROUGH Amazon you will usually pay shipping and the overall pricetag will be bigger.  And as I've stated on other reviews, other sellers that sell through Amazon sometimes ship slower or make mistakes with shipping... so know that going in.  On your major music retailers' sites this baby is going for $360 to $380.  Got it to my door for $304.  I really can't say enough about the ease of shopping, trustworthiness, and quick delivery of items sold by Amazon.  5 stars just for service... the fact that the Amp is awesome makes it that much better.You probably won't be able to find a carry case that fits this amp, but I bought the 'Singer Black universal Sewing Machine Tote' for just over $20 and it's perfect.  It fits the mini snugly, with room for odds and ends like cables and mics and maybe a few small pedals.  With my current setup I can walk in the room carrying the whole shebang in two hands, and that's really neat.  The closest 'amp case' would be $100 1x12 combo case that won't fit right and would take away from the whole portability thing.You're not going to find 20 lbs and $300 worth of quality amp anywhere else.  When compared to other makers (Fender/Roland) nothing gets the consistently good reviews that this little guy gets, and I understand why.  Recommend without hesitation!

"For those unfamiliar with Vox's amPlug products, these things are amazing.  I'm just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the 1990's, and they were mostly terrible.  What Vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers (which weigh virtually nothing, run for 10-15 hours on 2 AAA batteries, and plug directly into the guitar) is nothing short of amazing.  They have incredible amp-like tone and get as loud as you can possibly want.  Even through a pair of $20 Sony headphones, they sound amazing.  The star of the collection, in my opinion, is the Vox AC30 amPlug, which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to Top Boost overdrive.  If you haven't played an amPlug before, the AC30 one is $39.99 of the best money you'll ever spend.Now, getting to this specific Joe Satriani amPlug, it's impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself.  Fans of Joe Satriani (even casual ones) will recognize elements of this sound right away.  Satriani has a very distinctive sound, which he crafted over the years using a modified Boss DS-1 Distortion and (more recently) his Vox ""Satchurator"" Distortion Box.  It's a thick lead tone with a nice sustain, and colored with a delay effect.  Both of those elements are present on this signature amPlug.  You have a level control, a gain control, and a tone control.  There's also three switch positions: Off, On, and Fx.  The ""Fx"" position engages the delay effect, but the tone is otherwise the same.PROS:First, the price retails at $49.99, whereas most of the other models are $39.99.  (I believe the Lead amPlug is also $49.99 and also has a delay feature).  I think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money, but this is admittedly a sort of ""niche"" product.  Overall, however, you have several amPlugs to choose from, and if you choose this one, $49.99 is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone.  The tone has a real sweet spot between ""3"" and ""5"" that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes.  While it isn't necessarily and ""ideal"" rhythm guitar distortion, you can hit rich chords with nice sustain.  I prefer the tone on the higher gain levels, and you can really crank it up if you want to, but it sounds great at lower volumes too.  The delay is also surprisingly good - it's probably set to around the 400 milisecond gap, which is pretty standard.  Adds a cool echo ""fullness"" to your solo progressions, much like a classic Satriani solo.  Again, the overall tone is fantastic.  With the amount of gain provided, you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit (though I've always thought of Satch of more a technical, melodic guitarist than a ""metal"" guitarist).CONS:There are a few things to know about the Satriani signature model, but I don't think any of them should discourage you from checking it out.  While the delay is surprisingly good, you can't customize it.  You can't make the repeats shorter or longer, and you can't adjust the timing of the repeats.  Keep in mind that this is mostly a ""practice"" device for your personal use, however, and I still enjoy using the delay.  As for the tone, which I mostly discussed as a ""pro"" in the paragraph above, you should be aware that this is not meant to be a ""clean"" signal.  It is possible to get a somewhat clean tone by rolling back on the gain or lowering the volume of your guitar, but it's mostly distortion or bust.  The durability of all of the amPlugs has also been questioned by some.  The device is VERY lightweight and all plastic, except for the metal plug portion.  I don't doubt that you could bang it on something and break it quite easily.  The switches and dials may also fail over time.  But frankly, at $40 or $50, it's probably a better value than making it out of heavy duty metal and charging $100 for it, which would lock more people out of the market.  I would certainly buy another one (or several) if any of mine broke.  Finally, there as an audible ""hiss"" noise through your headphones anytime the device is on.  Slightly annoying when you're not playing, but I don't notice it at all once I start playing notes.THE VERDICT:One other ""dirty little secret"" to point out about these things: in addition to the Aux jack, which allows you to plug in an MP3 player and jam along, it is possible to use a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp, PA, or anything with speakers.  You might be surprised how good it sounds.As an after-note, I wrote most of this review playing on my Jackson DR6, which has two Seymour Duncan Humbuckers, and it sounded great.  I later tried it on a Gibson Les Paul (which is usually my primary guitar), and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers, it did not sound as good.  The distortion was much more ""fizzy"".  Haven't tried it with single coil pickups, but I think that it would likely work well with a Strat-type guitar due to the overall ""roundness"" of the tone.The amPlug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing, irrespective of their budget or living situation.  The Satriani model brings its own special character to the series, and if you like the tone as much as I do, might become an instant favorite.",music,unfamiliar vox amplug products things amazing old enough remember portable options mostly terrible vox done tiny headphone amplifiers weigh virtually nothing run hours aaa batteries plug directly guitar nothing short amazing incredible amp like tone get loud possibly want even pair sony headphones sound amazing star collection opinion vox ac amplug great vintage tube amp ranging sparkling cleans top boost overdrive played amplug ac one best money ever spend getting specific joe satriani amplug impossible talk tone without talking guitarist fans joe satriani even casual ones recognize elements sound right away satriani distinctive sound crafted years using modified boss ds distortion recently vox satchurator distortion box thick lead tone nice sustain colored delay effect elements present signature amplug level control gain control tone control also three switch positions fx fx position engages delay effect tone otherwise pros first price retails whereas models believe lead amplug also also delay feature think added delay feature unique tone worth extra money admittedly sort niche product overall however several amplugs choose choose one still incredible value ability play guitar virtually anywhere enjoy quality tone tone real sweet spot really makes enjoyable play lead notes necessarily ideal rhythm guitar distortion hit rich chords nice sustain prefer tone higher gain levels really crank want sounds great lower volumes delay also surprisingly good probably set around milisecond gap pretty standard adds cool echo fullness solo progressions much like classic satriani solo overall tone fantastic amount gain provided play types rock dabble metal guitar bit though always thought satch technical melodic guitarist metal guitarist cons things know satriani signature model think discourage checking delay surprisingly good customize make repeats shorter longer adjust timing repeats keep mind mostly practice device personal use however still enjoy using delay tone mostly discussed pro paragraph aware meant clean signal possible get somewhat clean tone rolling back gain lowering volume guitar mostly distortion bust durability amplugs also questioned device lightweight plastic except metal plug portion doubt could bang something break quite easily switches dials may also fail time frankly probably better value making heavy duty metal charging would lock people market would certainly buy another one several mine broke finally audible hiss noise headphones anytime device slightly annoying playing notice start playing notes verdict one dirty little secret point things addition aux jack allows plug mp player jam along possible use adapter audio cable plug thing directly amp pa anything speakers might surprised good sounds note wrote review playing jackson dr two seymour duncan humbuckers sounded great later tried gibson les paul usually primary guitar despite fact also two humbuckers sound good distortion much fizzy tried single coil pickups think would likely work well strat type guitar due overall roundness tone amplug great invention allows many players log endless hours practicing irrespective budget living situation satriani model brings special character series like tone much might become instant favorite

"I am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar.  I have learned a few songs, but I still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar.  I wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap.  I had the Dean Electric Guitars in the past and a Fender Acoustic a while ago.  The Fender and the Dean's were very nice.  I thought the Dean's had a very nice sound to them and so did the Fender.  This guitar has a very nice sound to it as well.  I couldn't figure out the different tunings on it though.  It said Rhythm and Treble and then just regular in the middle.  I kept it on the regular because it sounded normal.  The other one's must be for some special type of music.  But this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the Dean's.  It is also very easy to hold unlike the Dean's I have found.  The Dean's also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and I have not found one on this guitar which is a plus.

"This toy is so much fun for a little guy, mine was six months when we got it a month ago, and he just can't get enough of it.  Each week he finds new things to do with it.  At first having the balls on the spinning surface was just too noisy, it frightened him, so we left them off.  But now he loves putting them on and taking them off and watching them spin.

"I have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar, as that's what I learned on as a child. I can't afford it at the moment, so I decided to give these a shot.These do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination. I didn't expect them to - but a guy can dream, can't he?Anyway, what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overly-bright Takamine. It also helped with the rather high action. They play and sound softer. It's almost like having a new guitar.During the stringing/stretching process I broke the G string (go easy, they are silk after all) and so had to use a standard bronze replacement. I asked my non-music oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the 'oddball' string and she got it right on the first try.. that's how much of a difference these strings make. They sound less 'metallic' - that may sound obvious but my point is that it's a big difference, enough for her untrained ears to hear.I'm still saving up for a classical, but I really love these strings, and will be using them on my Tak going forward.",music,recently itching buy classical guitar learned child afford moment decided give shot turn steel string classical guitar stretch imagination expect guy dream anyway provide warm clear sound normally overly bright takamine also helped rather high action play sound softer almost like new guitar stringing stretching process broke g string go easy silk use standard bronze replacement asked non music oriented girlfriend could pick oddball string got right first try much difference strings make sound less metallic may sound obvious point big difference enough untrained ears hear still saving classical really love strings using tak going forward

You have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire.

"I've tried 5 of Kernel Season's flavors over the past month, and have found it to be a pretty great product for flavoring popcorn if you are the type who likes a little more than butter and salt to your snacks. The label reads &#34;Nothing Artificial&#34;, so that sounds good too. There are a variety of flavors of this product, as I mentioned, and most people will probably prefer some to others, and that's really the only thing to take issue here, other than the fact that, yes, you're dealing with a powdery product, so you may or may not like that element. One can sometimes detect a bit of chalkiness to it, might inhale a puff of it when diving in after a big dusting, so there are issues like that, but overall, especially if you really love the flavor you're using, it can add a lot to whatever you use it on (yeah, it doesn't have to be popcorn!). This 3 pack comes with a variety of flavors: Buffalo Wing, Ranch, and Kettle Corn. The great thing about this trio is that one of them acts as a dessert or sweet snack, which is a nice option to have, and it (talking about Kettle Corn here, of course) is really quite delicious. I also really liked the Ranch flavor. Possibly more than one I have tried before, White Cheddar, though I'm still undecided (White Cheddar is not included in this pack). The Buffalo Wing though, that's the one I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, the flavor is spot on. It tastes exactly like buffalo sauce such as you might have on wings, but I just am not so into that sauce that I want the flavor on my popcorn. In fact, I prefer my wings with a milder sauce. On top of that, ha, as this is a powder form of buffalo wing flavor, man, I don't know if I put too much on or what, but it went straight up my nose as I dug into the popcorn, and did it ever burn! I'm sure some folks will like the Buffalo Wing flavor, but I prefer the other two and am not sure I'll use the rest of the Buffalo Wing seasoning at all. That's just me though, and all these flavors deliver on their names!

"I bought this based on video reviews on the net.  My first impressions:To my ears, if the OCD / Ultimate OD simulates ""fat"" power tube distortion, this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube pre-amp, with a bit of edge, sharpness, the kind of edge the tube amps have.  The focus knob seems like a tone knob, maybe more in the upper mids than the treble, but it does the job well.I wish it had a bit more gain.  Surprisingly, this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10, gives me a great metal tone all by itself!  If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost, it gets me exactly where I'd want to be (a dry, tight metal tone, kinda 5150ish.  And while this isn't the purpose of the pedal, it is how I've ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps.  It's tight, its raw, there is no fizz and no boomyness, just a healthy low end.  Crank the knobs on this thing to 10 and you have a very aggressive, tight tone that makes even my Marshall Class 5 tight and grindy enough for Scandinavian style metal.Over all though, this is great for lightly distorted / edge of distorted sounds.  It gave my clean tone a sharper, more ""amp like"" tone (that is, midscooped slightly with the tone knob in the middle.) I think this would be great for Hendrix covers on his cleaner stuff, it just has that chimey, vintage amp character (very early marshalls, older fenders) with the ability to go from clean to dirty with simple attack variation.  If your clean channel is overly ""flat"", this will liven it up to more ""sharp"", scooped tone, which to my ears sounds more vintage.Basically, from Hendrix to modern de-tuned metal (with a definite mids emphasis - not ""80s marshall mids"" but  modern mids emphasis).",music,bought based video reviews net first impressions ears ocd ultimate od simulates fat power tube distortion pedal simulates lightly distorted tube pre amp bit edge sharpness kind edge tube amps focus knob seems like tone knob maybe upper mids treble job well wish bit gain surprisingly pedal gain tone gives great metal tone boost pedal say db clean boost gets exactly want dry tight metal tone kinda ish purpose pedal ended using sounds better amp sim produces less heat tube amps tight raw fizz boomyness healthy low end crank knobs thing aggressive tight tone makes even marshall class tight grindy enough scandinavian style metal though great lightly distorted edge distorted sounds gave clean tone sharper amp like tone midscooped slightly tone knob middle think would great hendrix covers cleaner stuff chimey vintage amp character early marshalls older fenders ability go clean dirty simple attack variation clean channel overly flat liven sharp scooped tone ears sounds vintage basically hendrix modern de tuned metal definite mids emphasis marshall mids modern mids emphasis

"I bought this because my band's primary PA mixer doesn't have high-impedance inputs for a guitar pickup, and I don't always want to bring my submixer for quick-change gigs. So, a small, cheap DI box seemed like a good solution.The PDC21 is a no-frills device. It converts a 1/4"" instrument cable (high Z) to a balanced/unbalanced 1/4"" or XLR (low Z) signal. It does a fine job. I don't notice it coloring the sound (i.e., it's not changing the balance of frequencies transmitted) although it does lower the volume somewhat. That's to be expected in a passive DI box, and it doesn't bother me.I'm using it with an LR Baggs M1A active soundhole pickup. The M1A spits out a fairly hot signal, and I don't have any problem with the signal loss associated with the PDC21. If I were using a passive pickup in my guitar, the results might be different.Bottom line: it's small, fairly light, seems durable, and it does a good job converting my active guitar signal to the XLR inputs our PA mixer requires. It does everything I wanted, and the price was right. I see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one.",music,bought band primary pa mixer high impedance inputs guitar pickup always want bring submixer quick change gigs small cheap di box seemed like good solution pdc frills device converts instrument cable high z balanced unbalanced xlr low z signal fine job notice coloring sound e changing balance frequencies transmitted although lower volume somewhat expected passive di box bother using lr baggs active soundhole pickup spits fairly hot signal problem signal loss associated pdc using passive pickup guitar results might different bottom line small fairly light seems durable good job converting active guitar signal xlr inputs pa mixer requires everything wanted price right see reason go shopping expensive one

"I am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up, dial it in and play it for a while.  I edited yet again as someone didn't appreciate my ""gloating"" over other guitars I own.  Sorry to offend YOU.I made a knee jerk review (again) right after I got this.  But in all fairness I received my Gibson Les Paul on the same day, buying IT from my local music store and professionally set up, ready to go.  I was comparing apples and oranges, so to speak.  But now, even after comparing them to each other, they really aren't that far apart.The Gibson is the best guitar I've ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it.  But this little baby is now my second favorite.My other review was NOT FAIR!!!!!!  I paid a lot more for the Gibson and 149 bucks for this Epiphone.  Dollar for dollar this little Ephiphone is a steal!!!!  WOW!!!I must honestly admit, the edge goes to my Gibson, but not by as much as you'd think.  This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar, regardless of price.  If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was $149 guitar, ever!  The tone of the Epiphone is much like the Gibson Les Paul.  It's easy to play, comfortable and has a sweet sound.  I can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock.To be honest, I will probably play this Epiphone a LOT more than the Gibson.  After all, if I ding this one up I haven't broke the bank.  I think I'll tend to use this one a lot more than the other.I am very happy with this Epiphone Les Paul and will proudly play and OWN it.  I am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge.  I may purchase another one and put it away as I'm sure the price won't stay this low.  PLUS, I'll get another one in a different color!!  You can never have too many guitars..  I am going to an a pickguard to this one.  The finish on it is outstanding and I'd like to keep it that way.If I were thinking of learning to play the guitar, this one is a no-brainer....BUY IT!!!If you're an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar, I'd buy this one is a heartbeat.  I was shocked at how sweet it sounds, how good it looks, how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays.

"I am a loyal customer of AMAZON. I did compare this bed to the cost competitors like Dream on me, Kidcraft,all the way up to Pottery Barn.What sold me on the bed, was the ""idea"" of solid wood.

My Fiance, put the first one together, I helped put the second on together. The directions are clear, the reader must be an above average RTA assembler. Otherwise, this may be too complicated. Overall, pretty simple to assemble.As the bed was assembled, I loved the option of turning the bed into a chair, don't see it happening. The bed is fairly small, so as the AD states 2-6 years old. I think more 2-5, would be pretty good. The double bed rails are a nice feature, then they usually sell for around $30 bucks, which is half the price of the bed ( I purchased at $59.00). So that's what cinched the deal for me. I ordered two blacks beds, I think they look close to the ones sold by Pottery Barn, at a fraction of the price. The kolKraft Mattress, fit perfectly.

"This stroller frame may be fine for many infant seats, but it does not work properly with Chicco seats, as it states in the description.  It claims to be compatible but it really is not.  The seats do not sit down securely and are very unstable.  Also,  even getting them in the stroller is quite an ordeal and requires careful maneuvering AND they have to overlap a little.  The only way the Chicco seats will fit in is without the sanp feature, and sitting very low in the frame. This renders the basket unusable when used with Chicco seats.  I did try a Chicco seat at a store with the single snap and go frame and it fit ok, even without the snap feature. I expected the double to work the same way, but it does not.  It is much more unstable and does not even have a bar at the back for the front of the seat to rest on. It can pitch forward very easily, even with the ""safety strap"" which is not a substitute for a stable way to attach the car seat to the frame. They really should not claim that this product is compatible with Chicco seats, because it really is not.

"This is nearly identical to theGuardian Cases CG-020-B Bass Guitar Caseat about half the cost. However, there are some issues with this case as well as limitations.First the issues: while the covering appears to be stitched on, it is - for the most part - glued on, and if the case is left in a hot, unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges. On the other hand, someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car (or garage or other storage space) for prolonged periods. However, you should be aware of the issue, if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers, imagine the effect on your bass.The limitations are simple: the case, while a hard shell design, is not as strong as one made from ABS plastic. The top is relatively flimsy as are the sides. This is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs, but if you have a heavy road schedule, and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the band's gear, this case will not afford you the protection of an ATA-style case.Also note that I have only used this case for a Fender Jazz Bass, so any long-scale J- or P-style basses will fit. I cannot be sure about other brands and models.I mentioned an ATA-style case as a better solution, and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules. For less demanding protection I recommend that you also consider this case (which I purchased as an upgrade when I became aware of the issues and limitations of the Musician's Gear model:SKB Electric Bass Rectangular Hardshell, standard latches, handle.If you still opt for the Musician's Gear case, you are still getting relatively good value and are certainly making a large step up from a soft gig bag.",music,nearly identical theguardian cases cg b bass guitar caseat half cost however issues case well limitations first issues covering appears stitched part glued case left hot unventilated space like car prolonged periods covering start life edges hand someone takes care gear probably going leave instrument hot car garage storage space prolonged periods however aware issue reason remind case suffers imagine effect bass limitations simple case hard shell design strong one made abs plastic top relatively flimsy sides show stopper use case home storage occasional gigs heavy road schedule especially personally loading unloading band gear case afford protection ata style case also note used case fender jazz bass long scale j p style basses fit sure brands models mentioned ata style case better solution essential protecting instrument heavy road even local gig schedules less demanding protection recommend also consider case purchased upgrade became aware issues limitations musician gear model skb electric bass rectangular hardshell standard latches handle still opt musician gear case still getting relatively good value certainly making large step soft gig bag

"This bag was nicer than I expected for the price. Considering that many soprano ukuleles are in the $20 t0 $100 range, a lot of people won't want to buy a hard case for three times the price of this gig bag or for more money than their instrument cost.The case is better padded than I might have expected for the price. Since soprano ukuleles are small and lightweight instruments, it's not clear to me why a hard case would be as important to most people as it might be to somebody evaluating guitar cases, or cases for other larger instruments.If you have a small child who is likely to sit on the instrument or drop it down the stairs constantly, you might want to consider something better. But this should provide adequate protection in general, even from minor falls.

"I borrowed this swing from a friend when I had my twins.  Within 6 weeks the controls shorted out.  Once you turned it on, you could not turn it off unless you removed the batteries.  So I bought the same swing (I wanted to return a working swing to her).  I used it for about 6 weeks & it did the same thing.  Since it was new I called Graco & they sent me a replacement motor.  Just a few weeks later I had to call Graco again because, yet again, it shorted out.  They have sent me another replacement motor & I am going to put it together & return it to my friend because I HATE this swing.  The reason it got 2 stars is because Graco has been fabulous.

"I can't speak on the claim for a longer string life.  The strings are true to Elixir's quality and tone.  These strings sound great plug and unplugged.  I also had the opportunity from Vine to try the phosphor bronze too.  There are tonal differences as expected.  The 80/20 are brighter, but the tones are clear and crisp.  When amplified, I did note less finger noise as I re-positioned or slid my fingers along the strings.  I didn't notice any difference to the feel of the string...as compared to other nanoweb Elixir strings that I have used over the years.

"I really hate the waste, both economic and paper, of those little packets of sweetener.  I buy Splenda in big bags and I am glad this now comes in a bag as well.  The bag is relatively small compared to the standard Splenda amount, but keep in mind that Splenda has filler to make the measurement 1:1 with sugar, while this is 2:1.  In other words, you only need to use half as much.I previously reviewed the packets, which was my first experience with Stevia.  I found it very bitter at the time, but, much like artificial sweeteners, I have adapted and now enjoy Stevia much more.  Because this product also contains sugar, I think it makes a good product for beginners who want to shed some calories without jumping in completely.  I started by checking the nutritional information, which claimed ten calories per half-teaspoon serving.  That seemed like an extremely small amount, so I actually pulled out the measuring scoop and used it for my hot tea.  Even with the heat, which I have found increases the bitterness, this amount worked quite well.  I think using too much of this product can make it overly bitter rather than super sweet like pure sugar or Splenda.  With this realization, I tossed the half-teaspoon measuring scoop into the bag so I am ready to pull out the optimal amount any time.It is impossible for me to tell you if you will like this product.  After an initial poor experience, though, it has been great for me.  I honestly haven't suffered any negative side effects from using Splenda, but it is psychologically comforting to know that I am using something natural instead.",grocery,really hate waste economic paper little packets sweetener buy splenda big bags glad comes bag well bag relatively small compared standard splenda amount keep mind splenda filler make measurement sugar words need use half much previously reviewed packets first experience stevia found bitter time much like artificial sweeteners adapted enjoy stevia much product also contains sugar think makes good product beginners want shed calories without jumping completely started checking nutritional information claimed ten calories per half teaspoon serving seemed like extremely small amount actually pulled measuring scoop used hot tea even heat found increases bitterness amount worked quite well think using much product make overly bitter rather super sweet like pure sugar splenda realization tossed half teaspoon measuring scoop bag ready pull optimal amount time impossible tell like product initial poor experience though great honestly suffered negative side effects using splenda psychologically comforting know using something natural instead

"I purchased this to interface the XLR plug on a Sennheiser E825-S mike with the input on guitar amplifiers. it seemed to work very well in this role. It was well-constructed, with all the connecting points working precisely and securely.Somewhat after the fact, I started worrying about whether I should have instead gotten an adapter with impedance matching capabilities. I'm hardly a professional technician in this area, but I did do enough research to figure out a good working answer: Lo-Z (low impedance) microphones (say, 1,000 ohms or less) generally do not have to be matched to solid-state amplifiers, which are likely to have Hi-Z (high impedance) inputs in the range of 10,000 ohms. These amplifiers ae generally designed to accommodate a 10:1 impedance ratio (load to source). I calculated the signal loss of such an arrangement in the range of 0.83 decibels, which is incidental.This corresponds to what my ears tell me: this adapter works just fine without impedance matching. I can't say for sure whether that also holds for tube amps but will update my review if I have a chance to find out.UPDATE: since I wrote my initial review, I have discovered that Pyle seems to have a problem securing its connectors properly with set screws.

"The Behringer ACX-450 is a good looking, great sounding amp in a small package, but should be used at low to medium volume.  At higher volumes one has to take care with the equalizer to reduce bass and midrange, and also use the anti-feedback button, to avoid a ""muddy"" sound from too much (distorted?) bass.  This not an amp to play loudly, but rather for low-to-mid volume accompaniment in a smaller venue.As to the sound effects, it is great with 16 effects covering reverb, chorus, delay/echo and many combinations.  I especially like that you can have all the effects with totally different settings on either channel.  Also nice to have a separate XLR microphone input on channel 2.The CD/MP3 input is good for backgrounds (or maybe drum machine) when playing, or music during breaks, although one needs a cable with RCA plugs to connect it.

"First, I have thick, wavy, dark hair. I also suffer from itchy scalp, so I was using a few different medicated shampoos with mixed results. The medicated shampoos (Selsun Blue, Head N Shoulders) stopped the itching, but made my hair look terrible. It was oily at the scalp and very frizzy on the ends.So, I ordered this and gave it a try. It was weird at first, because it doesn't lather-- I kept wanting it to foam up, and to tell you the truth, I haven't quite gotten used to that yet. But even after the first time I used it, my hair was soft, silky, and not frizzy at all. I let it air-dry and then I flat-ironed it. Flat ironing took less than 5 minutes, and it was even shiner (my hair is cut just above the shoulder). And my scalp did NOT itch.

"I love my Snark SN5 tuner.  It works smoothly without any issues, and allows me to tune my guitar swiftly and accurately.  All you need to do is clamp the tuner to the headstock, and it is ready to go.  The SN5 is smaller than I expected, but the multicolored meter is easily readable, and the meter can adjusted so that it can be seen clearly from any position.Using the color coded meter, you can tell whether a string is flat or sharp, and adjust the string tension accordingly.  With a little practice, tuning becomes a quick and easy process.  The unit is powered by a CR 2032 battery, which generally has a long life.Although the clamp has rubber pads, apparently the finishes of certain guitars could still be prone to damage.  The instructions states that the Snark is not recommended for guitars with the following finishes, polyurethane, French polish, and nitrocellulose lacquer.  Those with Gibson, Gretch, or Taylor guitars may want pay particular attention to this warning.  I have had no problems using this tuner on Kramer, Ibanez, Charvel, Epiphone, and ESP guitars.  The tuner also works for bass guitars and violins.  I do not have either of those instruments, but I imagine the tuner would work much the same.As there are a number of guitar tuners that attach to the headstock, it took me a little while to decide on the SN5.  Even after eliminating tuners by D'Addario and Planet Waves, selecting the SN5 wasn't that simple, as Snark makes a number of similar tuners.  I am completely satisfied with the SN5, and believe that it fully deserves a 5 star rating.  It is also the least expensive, of the tuners I was considering buying.  If the finish of your guitar isn't an issue, you may find the Snark to be very helpful.",music,love snark sn tuner works smoothly without issues allows tune guitar swiftly accurately need clamp tuner headstock ready go sn smaller expected multicolored meter easily readable meter adjusted seen clearly position using color coded meter tell whether string flat sharp adjust string tension accordingly little practice tuning becomes quick easy process unit powered cr battery generally long life although clamp rubber pads apparently finishes certain guitars could still prone damage instructions states snark recommended guitars following finishes polyurethane french polish nitrocellulose lacquer gibson gretch taylor guitars may want pay particular attention warning problems using tuner kramer ibanez charvel epiphone esp guitars tuner also works bass guitars violins either instruments imagine tuner would work much number guitar tuners attach headstock took little decide sn even eliminating tuners addario planet waves selecting sn simple snark makes number similar tuners completely satisfied sn believe fully deserves star rating also least expensive tuners considering buying finish guitar issue may find snark helpful

"This string compares significantly to the Pro-Arte string.  The sizes are the same but it costs a buck or two less.  It's so similar I contacted D'Addario to ask them what the difference was.  They stated the Pro-Arte strings are made of a better nylon and to more stringent specs... but in all honesty I wonder if the strings aren't identical but these marketed primarily to students and schools as a more economical string.Whatever is the actuality-- both sets are of quality manufacture.  They're D'Addario... and D'Addario never produces junk.  Their cheapest string is as good or better than more expensive strings in other brands.  I've never used a set of D'Addario in any classification of guitar that I didn't like.For those who are curious, I'd recommend doing what I did:  buy a set of these and a set of the Pro-Arte (they're both pretty inexpensive) and compare and see which you like best... or if you like both equally.  I think it would be good to get several reviews here of such a test between the two grades.

"First of all this is NOT the best microphone ever made.  But for what they cost they certainly are more than I expected.  I give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration.  They are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure. I bought one Behringer XM8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go.  However, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal SM-58's are busy at another job.  I honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the Behringers.  At one time Alice Cooper and his band were using the Behringer XM8500's, however they may have moved on now for all I know.These are not Shure SM-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs.  They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the Shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly.  They are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq.  It also is if anything more versatile than the SM-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an SM-57 to pick up.  It doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM-58.  It has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen.  Another strength of these is durability.  My 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall.  No damage at all to any of them!  I used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now I just shrug. One weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue.  Mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters.  The stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable. If you want SM-58's you need to buy SM-58's.  If you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these.  No on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the SM-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability!  I don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price.  You can pay more and get less.",music,first best microphone ever made cost certainly expected give stars microphone period without even taking low cost consideration much better next cheapest thing worth extra sure bought one behringer xm two couple months later planning use rehearsal microphones geezer band start years go however actually used vocals live performances sound tech personal sm busy another job honestly think sound either way maybe little clearer behringers one time alice cooper band using behringer xm however may moved know shure sm clones even though appear cosmetic knockoffs slightly hotter output flat response ears shure pronounced lower mid boost makes male voice sound bigger sometimes distorted eq ed correctly ideal backup vocal microphone since behringer behaves like compromise microphone tailored male voice microphone tailored female voice actually works well without heavy eq also anything versatile sm useful acoustic instrument pickup microphone working anything would ordinarily use sm pick overload easily high output tight pattern feedback rejection sm reasonably decent blast filter using outdoor instrument pickup add windscreen another strength durability sustained numerous drops couple falls happened boom stand mounted microphone fall weight boom stand behind adding mass force fall damage used cringe fell got dropped shrug one weak point sensitive handling noise stand handling noise issue mine came hard plastic foam lined cases stand adapters stand adapters sort flimsy usable want sm need buy sm want good around microphone class try one switch switches sm use frankly switch liability think find better microphone new money recommend decent around microphone price pay get less

"UPDATE: 15 July 2013I still really love how these assist in quick tuning, but MAN, are they FLIMSY.All of my other musician friends- who also LOVE this tuner's ability to grab the right pitch- also have employed copious amounts of super glue to re-attach the neck and clip to the body of the tuner.So, in short, this is a mixed bag. I would rate the abilities of the actual tuner at somewhere over 6 stars- EASILY my favorite ever in this capacity... combined with the absolutely DEPLORABLE build quality of the clip itself.Sigh.It's such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends... only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer.If SNARK fixes the problem, I would instantly bring the rating back up to my original 5 star rating... but until then...and I LOVE this tuner... 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.Boo.(ORIGINAL REVIEW)I have had similar tuners in the past... and by similar, I mean clip on...Nearly every other tuner I have had has not maintained a reading, which translated into what felt like a game of keep away, where I was the frustrated kid in the middle who could never quite catch the pitch.I am willing to bet that lots of folks have had this experience with many tuners. Not only that, but many of these tuners run upwards of twenty bucks, if not more.So I was skeptical. But so many high reviews couldn't be wrong, and for the price I figured it was a fairly risk free gamble.Really glad I tried it out!The screen is clear and easy to read, and the pitch indicator holds steady in one spot. No more chasing pitch for me!Haven't needed to use the vibration/ mic option yet, but I am sure that will come in handy at some point.Planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well.Definitely recommended!",music,update july still really love assist quick tuning man flimsy musician friends also love tuner ability grab right pitch also employed copious amounts super glue attach neck clip body tuner short mixed bag would rate abilities actual tuner somewhere stars easily favorite ever capacity combined absolutely deplorable build quality clip sigh bummer rave product friends follow obligatory disclaimer snark fixes problem would instantly bring rating back original star rating love tuner stars rounded boo original review similar tuners past similar mean clip nearly every tuner maintained reading translated felt like game keep away frustrated kid middle could never quite catch pitch willing bet lots folks experience many tuners many tuners run upwards twenty bucks skeptical many high reviews wrong price figured fairly risk free gamble really glad tried screen clear easy read pitch indicator holds steady one spot chasing pitch needed use vibration mic option yet sure come handy point planning getting another one instruments well definitely recommended

"Update: I've finished the entire bottle and actually bought more in the sweet pom scent. It took a few uses of this to not feel crunchy, like my hair had to get used to it. But now that I've used the entire bottle, my hair craves it. I no longer have the issue of rinsing constantly, crunchy hair, or waxy feeling follicles. Personally, I'm adoring this stuff. I'll continue buying it as long as my hair wants it. I feel its a good price since a bottle will last me several months. A lot of people on here are saying that they have to use a ton of the product, but you really don't. If you follow the curly girl method of washing your hair it'll only take you 4-6 pumps to do your entire head (I have shoulder length hair).I'll start off by saying that I haven't used a sulfate product on my hair in 4 years and I went 'poo free almost a year ago, with amazing results in my naturally curly hair. But, as luck would have it, I lost my extra bars of homemade lye soap that I usually use and couldn't wait the time it would take to get more shipped. Off to Walgreens, I searched in vain for 10 minutes looking for Renpure Miracle Conditioner as I had used it in the past in a pinch and it worked to clean my hair without harsh chemicals. Alas, no such thing existed in my local Walgreens anymore. I slunk back to the hair care (using this term loosely because most of those products don't really care for your beautiful tresses) aisle after asking a blank-faced, gum snapping employee and started my search anew. This time I was searching out every single product that didn't contain sulfates. Piling them all into my buggy, I started eliminating them right off. Loreal? No. Organix? Tempting because I love the scents but no. It went back on the shelf. Then I came to this product. I've heard of cleansing conditioners, I mean who hasn't stayed up late and seen an infomercial? After reading the back of it and cringing at the unnecessary ingredients that I would be dumping onto my hair and into the water stream, I left it in my buggy. What's a girl to do when she only has one day to find something to wash her hair with before people start crossing the streets and avoiding eye contact?Earlier tonight, I got up for work and after making a naked mad dash into the livingroom where I had left this, I slathered it on and scrubbed. And waited. And rinsed. And rinsed. And rinsed again for good measure. I spent more time rinsing my hair tonight then I normally spend on a week in the shower. But, apparently, I didn't spend enough time. After watching my hard-earned dollars fall down the drain in the form of liquid, I stopped rinsing. My hair still felt waxy. Clean, but waxy. And it was as straight as a board that hasn't been exposed to moisture. This was my first sign that something was wrong. My hair normally curls up in the water. I went trucking on. To match my (hopefully) clean hair, I gave a quick scrub to the rest of me, rinsed everything (hair included)and jumped out.Pure bliss! After squeezing the water out of my hair with a 100% cotton t-shirt (to eliminate frizz), I was able to run a curl comb directly through it without snagging at all. I loved it. I scrunched it and was ready to go. Fast forward an hour. My hair is now completely dry. And crunchy. Good news is that there is no frizz. Bad news is that after wasting 100 gallons of water that third world countries would gladly murder me for, I didn't rinse it enough.My hair is crunchy even though I have no product in it. It feels light and airy (and a little waxy). Not heavy at all as others are reporting. It formed the most perfect curls my head has ever seen without the use of heated torture devices. But it is f-ing crunchy. Not cool Renpure. Not cool.I'll continue to use this on the chance that my hair may just need to get used to it. Maybe it's like growing up at a nudist resort and then suddenly being thrown into corporate America.

"These strings are really nice.  They have a great tone, decent longevity, and the trademark Ernie Ball feel.  Some reviewers have stated that the strings have a silky feel - even comparing them to coated strings - but I don't find that to be the case.  They feel pretty much like any other guitar string, albeit much gentler than stainless strings.  If money were no option, I'd probably move to these exclusively, but at roughly three times the price of good to great nickel strings, I'm not sure that they are good enough to justify the massive price premium.  Each string did come inside its own protective sleeve, which made restringing easier and is a feature that I absolutely expect from a premium string.",music,strings really nice great tone decent longevity trademark ernie ball feel reviewers stated strings silky feel even comparing coated strings find case feel pretty much like guitar string albeit much gentler stainless strings money option probably move exclusively roughly three times price good great nickel strings sure good enough justify massive price premium string come inside protective sleeve made restringing easier feature absolutely expect premium string

He likes to grip and study whatever you place in his hands, really focusing on the toy, but he still has trouble actually hanging on to things for very long. Since he's now working on his first set of teeth I finally caved and bought this thing, figuring that with all the different gripping options he'd really love the thing. And I was right! Not only that, but my oldest thought the squeaker inside was the greatest thing ever. They both took turns playing with Sophie, the oldest squeaking, and the youngest gnawing away. It was easy for the kids to hold on to, and I liked that it gave the little one another option for chewing besides his fingers or a pacifier. I also like that it will be easy for me to clean since the surface is a smooth rubber.

"Great little amp to mess around with. The various sound changes and the range of sound mimics is amazing. The software that came with it is a little limited for true professionals but has more than you need for home use. Don't be fooled by the small size, this baby pumps out the noise quite well. I'd rarely turn my master volume above level 4 (of 10) for home use and at small local taverns I'd set it at around level 8. For a regular venue I have an extra Marshall 500-watt speaker system.You will need time to read the manual and learn the settings making it fun to see what kind of effects you can get. No pedals needed with this thing. I only gave it 4-stars because I later bought the Mustang III which has a bunch more features for an extra $200 and a blow-out 100-watt speaker. (The Mustang IV is the same as the III but with 150-watts. Again, you can but an extra 100-watt speaker for $40, making the extra $200 for a Mustang IV a waste.) The Mustang II is the same as this one but with a 40-watt speaker and $100 more.If you need something to play with at home and want to try different effects and sounds this is a good one at a cheap price. If you want the extra 20-watts (of the Mustang II) just buy this one and an extra 20-watt speaker (around $30) and jury rig it. Otherwise I recommend plunking the extra $200 and get the Mustang III with a digital display readout and more effects.",music,great little amp mess around various sound changes range sound mimics amazing software came little limited true professionals need home use fooled small size baby pumps noise quite well rarely turn master volume level home use small local taverns set around level regular venue extra marshall watt speaker system need time read manual learn settings making fun see kind effects get pedals needed thing gave stars later bought mustang iii bunch features extra blow watt speaker mustang iv iii watts extra watt speaker making extra mustang iv waste mustang ii one watt speaker need something play home want try different effects sounds good one cheap price want extra watts mustang ii buy one extra watt speaker around jury rig otherwise recommend plunking extra get mustang iii digital display readout effects
"I read the reviews here on Amazon and was kind of turned off of buying it at first. Eventually I went ahead and sprung for it since it wasn't expensive. I only needed one, and expected the package to come with just one, but it has two locks so that was a pleasant surprise. I've had them for 2-3 months now and they haven't failed me yet. They keep the strap in place just fine and are fairly sturdy for plastic pieces. Really helped a lot because my strap would keep slipping off the knob and I had to use my ninja skills to get the guitar before it hit the floor. The only complaint I have is that they fit a bit tight with my strap (though it could be my nylon strap is just a bit too thick) and they are an EXTREMELY snug fit which makes me kinda nervous. However, I keep them as tight as I can while still allowing them to rotate a bit so everything is fine so far. Not sure why the other reviews were so negative, but I have no complaints.",music,read reviews amazon kind turned buying first eventually went ahead sprung since expensive needed one expected package come one two locks pleasant surprise months failed yet keep strap place fine fairly sturdy plastic pieces really helped lot strap would keep slipping knob use ninja skills get guitar hit floor complaint fit bit tight strap though could nylon strap bit thick extremely snug fit makes kinda nervous however keep tight still allowing rotate bit everything fine far sure reviews negative complaints

"By the time my daughter was 3 weeks old, my husband and I were getting desperate to find something she's sleep more than 1 hr in at night, besides our arms.We tried:1. A cradle - she would start crying being lowered into it.2. A baby hammock - better, felt like she was still being held, but since she's head-heavy she weighted down the head too much and would sound like she was choking if we put her down too soon after eating.3. This Rock and Play Sleeper - she was inclined, so she didn't make the choking sounds, but she would start squirming and crying after 5 minutes because she was uncomfortable. It's not well padded.4. An in-bed-cosleeper - just so we wouldn't have to get out of bed to comfort her.5. This Rock and Play Sleeper WITH Snuzzler - dream come true! She slept for 3 hour stretches all night long from 9pm to 9am!I was really disappointed in this product when we tried it as-is. I wanted to like it and I'm so glad she loves it now that we added the snuzzler - I like that it's elevated so our cats don't bother her, I like that it glides easily on the carpet so I can scoot her around without waking her, I love that it's compact and doesn't take up lot of room, and I love the price!Finally sleep! Precious sleep!(4 stars because it needs another product added to it to make it comfortable)-----Update:3 months old, has acid reflux. We added a few prefold diapers (unfolded) between the plastic and the cover for a little extra cushion (they are the perfect size). The snuzzler makes it a bit too snug for her now so we are only using the head support part of it so that her head doesn't slouch to the side. No flat spot or muscular problems.

"The latest addition to my desktop is the most flexible recording device I've yet found: The Blue Microphones Yeti USB Microphone. Long known for their line of high-end condenser microphones, Blue is increasingly known for their computer-ready USB microphones, like the Snowflake and the Snowball, and the Yeti is their latest and certainly greatest computer-ready microphone yet.Advertised as the first fully THX-compliant (a standard devised by Lucasfilms) microphone,  the Yeti is a large (12"" tall on its removable stand), hefty, multi-pattern microphone suitable for recording, podcasting, or any other computer-related audio activity. It features four switchable patterns- omni, carodid, figure eight, and stereo- a built in headphone amplifier, gain control, headpohone volume, and a mute button. For even more flexibility you can remove it from its desk stand and mount it on a standard 5/8""microphone stand or boom.And it sounds great, too- even better than their well-regarded Snowball series. I've been using it for recording music practice, building tracks with Audacity on my Windows and linux boxes, and with Apple's GarageBand, and making calls with Skype. The ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus. Up to now I've been using a variety of microphones together with various microphone preamps and an A/D converters- a mass of cables and power supplies that bad enough on the desk, but a real hassle when trying to use with a laptop away from home. The Yeti has it all in one package.

"I like the idea of these squeeze bottles and I will investigate how cost effective it is to use them instead of the cans which work well for me.I have been using sweetened condensed milk in my coffee, off and on since learning to use it as a child at my grandparent's adjacent farm over on the other side of the squash field.  My Father preferred HEAVY cream (we had our own cows) sweetened with THREE teaspoons of sugar but even as a child, I did not care for that over the top combo normally favored by those engaged in heavy labor (a good description of my father with his day job and plowing at night by tractor headlights) as a quick caloric boost.  In these sedentary days, your doctor would put you on the don't call back list for such a dietary sin.  I actually prefer BLACK coffee when making a brew with my favored fresh ground (Vietnamese, espresso) but I was given a Keurig as a present and all the K-cups available taste better to me with some milk in them and those machines are too easy to use for that first quick jolt in the AM. The canned milk is very rich and it will last forever in the refrigerator, unlike any fresh milk/cream.  I find that La Lechera seems to be less sweet than the old standby, Eagle Brand and that pleases me.  This brand works perfectly for Vietnamese iced coffee which if you have never had, I suggest you try soon-- I enjoy it on an occasional basis in the summer and everyone I have introduced to it likes it a great deal.Anyway, I had the same problems with storing open containers until I realized that pet food can lids would work well.  They are (presumably) food grade plastic, inexpensive at the pet super stores and fit the condensed milk cans perfectly (same size as a standard tuna/cat food can)-- some are even cleverly molded to fit several different sizes of can to also fit the larger cans.  With normal handling, the milk NEVER touches the lid so even mystery plastic should not be a great consideration but I would look for a brand that is not made in China from industrial waste if that is possible anymore-- I have 4-5 that I have been using as pet food lids for years, acquired pre-Chinese economic invasion.  These lids work better and easier than the side cutting can openers which provide the cutoff part of the can as a lid!",grocery,like idea squeeze bottles investigate cost effective use instead cans work well using sweetened condensed milk coffee since learning use child grandparent adjacent farm side squash field father preferred heavy cream cows sweetened three teaspoons sugar even child care top combo normally favored engaged heavy labor good description father day job plowing night tractor headlights quick caloric boost sedentary days doctor would put call back list dietary sin actually prefer black coffee making brew favored fresh ground vietnamese espresso given keurig present k cups available taste better milk machines easy use first quick jolt canned milk rich last forever refrigerator unlike fresh milk cream find la lechera seems less sweet old standby eagle brand pleases brand works perfectly vietnamese iced coffee never suggest try soon enjoy occasional basis summer everyone introduced likes great deal anyway problems storing open containers realized pet food lids would work well presumably food grade plastic inexpensive pet super stores fit condensed milk cans perfectly size standard tuna cat food even cleverly molded fit several different sizes also fit larger cans normal handling milk never touches lid even mystery plastic great consideration would look brand made china industrial waste possible anymore using pet food lids years acquired pre chinese economic invasion lids work better easier side cutting openers provide cutoff part lid

"I purchased mine as a Prime item, sold by Nature and Herbs. It arrived quickly and in a container with a lid that was VERY secure. This is my second purchase of shea butter and I think I prefer this one over theTangerine Lime Shea Butter, because it smells almost identical and it's much cheaper. In reading the mixed reviews, many people commented on the smell. Raw shea butter has an earthy smell to it, which many people may not realize. It doesn't mean it's bad. It's not offensive, but it might take a little time to get used to it. When I first smelled it I wasn't impressed, but my husband said he really liked it. This is a great value for a wonderful product. It leaves my very dry skin feeling supple and oh-so-soft. It's not greasy, it's not like a lotion, it's just quite different and I love it. It's really firm in the tub, and you just scoop a little out and rub between your palms. This friction transforms the shea butter into a creamy, almost like oil, but not quite, consistency. I plan on taking some of my shea butter and making a whipped body butter with coconut oil and essential oils. It's so easy to just take a big bowl, hand-held mixer, and these few natural ingredients to make a skin moisturizer that is so much better for your skin, smells better, is cheaper, and without all the parabens, coloring, and ""fragrance"" that most store bought lotions contain. There are many videos on YouTube that show how easy this is to do. I'll definitely be buying more.Oh, and surprisingly, on the lid it gives several uses of the benefits of shea butter. One of those is that it helps relieve arthritis. Well, I've got arthritis throughout my body, and after using the Nature's Shea Butter (meaning BEFORE I even saw the reference that it would help relieve arthritis symptoms) I had noticed I was waking up in the morning with less pain and swelling in my hands.

"I'm not going to do any explaining about the ""science"" behind how this pedal works. I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone. This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal. To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone. Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob doesn't ""increase"" the amount of bass produced by the amp. Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone. To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't. You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better.Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect. At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off. With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a ""night and day"" difference.I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better. This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the ""must have"" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone. This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones.",music,going explaining science behind pedal works going focus review pedal affects tone definitely boost also eq bbe sonic stomp uniquely functioning pedal ear serves add clarity depth body tone essentially pedal allows get tones amp already producing lo contour knob increase amount bass produced amp rather tightens generally increases depth bass low mid tone ear may sound first like bass increased hearing bass tone first place jumbled signal went guitar amp process knob really focuses treble high mid frequencies frequencies often unpleasant grating hear sonic stomp sort evens smooths tones clearer less harsh say dial aggressive cutting highs play lead metal something indeed make searing lead tones even better gave product stars issues way unsatisfied rather really fairly subtle effect first almost tell difference time able better recognize appreciate impact tone make night day difference recommend pedal someone already tone happy want make even better pedal make cheap watt solid state combo sound like tube half stack make love tone completely unsatisfied conclusion though definitely put pedal must category definitely improves quality tone pedal leave time improves clean distorted tones

"I have used hot rollers for years.  From the good old days of the plastic ones to the ones you had to use the U-shaped clips that burned your finger tips.  Now the era of Tourmaline and Ceramic is upon us - which of course has been proven to be better for your hair.  Both technologies give better heat distribution and will not strip hair of moisture or oils, which prevents the cuticle from damaging or splitting.I am Latina and have very, very thick hair.  I straighten my hair with a keratin treatment every 3 to 4 months.  Putting hot rollers in my hair is very easy and using the Infiniti Pro by Conair and I was ready to go out the door in less than 30 minutes.  I like to get the rollers as hot as possible because that allows a better set in your hair.  The ""ready in 85 seconds"" is not long enough for me.  I let them heat up for at least 5 to 10 minutes.  I also allow them to sit in my hair until they are COMPLETELY cooled.  The clips hold the hot roller securely in place.  The variety of different sized ""flocked"" (fuzzy coating that grab your hair) rollers in this set offer a variety of different hair-do, up-do, and glamor style possibilities.The added bonus of the Argan oil is nice since I useAgadir  Argan Oil Spray Treatmentprior to blow drying and as a finishing mist.

"Great crib so far.It was easy to assemble for the most part.  Getting the little pellet shaped nuts into the pre-drilled holes and lined up to accept the screws was a fight against gravity at some points since the directions and physics make you have to assemble things where the nut had to go into a hole the was facing the floor. But with 2 people working together (one just holding things together waiting for screws), it worked out ok.  I think it would be really tough to do this with one person.  Crib is sturdy once assembled.  Not any sort of shifting or creaking when sliding it around on the carpet to position it where we wanted it.For those of you who are worried about what mattress to get...I have the answer for you.  We got theSafety 1st Heavenly Dreams Crib Mattress, White.  It is a 100% perfect fit.  Snug against the sides of the crib on every side.  Good thickness, and good level of firmness. Waterproof cover, etc...  Anyway, back to the crib.No scratches so far...which seemed to be a complaint some people had.We currently have the spring frame at the highest level.  I can see that it might be a chore to lower it in the future since the spring frame was put in before the front of the crib was attached...... Unscrewing it and then reattaching might be an acrobatic act with the front attached the whole time...Also, I noticed that it seems most of the bad reviews talked about how the front horizontal rail is a death trap where the kid gets an arm or leg stuck in there while trying to climb out.  Seriously people, see that as what it really is.  It is an anti-escape system ;)  Once your kid gets stuck in there once, they will not try to escape again.  Added benefit.

"This review is part of a round of reviews of baby carriers my wife wrote, including her takes on the Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining (5 stars), theBoba Classic Baby Carrier, Glacier(4 stars), theInfantino Ecosash Baby Carrier, Bloomin Vines, 8-35 Pounds(3 stars), and theInfantino Balance Baby Carrier, Spindles, 8-35 Pounds(2 stars).  Here's her general intro:""I'm 5'5"" and around 130 lbs.  Husband is 6' and around 170 lbs.  Our children seem to grow quickly, both over 15 lbs by 3 months of age, so a good carrier is vital to the health of our backs!  There are many features to each carrier that I will try to touch on, and most of them have both pros and cons associated, so I might say one feature is a benefit, but I may also mention its drawbacks, or vice versa.  We all have differently tempered and built babes and toddlers, differently shaped bodies, and different needs, so please take these reviews for what they're worth: my humble opinions.And here's her take on the Bjorn:""Both DH and I loved this carrier for the newest babies 8-12 lbs.PROS:* It holds them close or hanging loosely away depending on what babe likes and how tight you pull the straps.* Once you become used to the fasteners, it is super-easy and quick to put on and can even be put on with one hand while holding the baby (if pre-clipped in some spots).* It is easily adjustable from mom to dad sizing.* The clip in the back on the arm straps keep the carrier from getting looser as you carry.* The stiff supporting body keeps the wee babes upright and their breathing passages open.* The face-out position is very simple to configure and can be done without putting the baby down, while still wearing the carrier.CONS:* Like I said, we loved this carrier, but really only for babies from 8-10 or 12 pounds (which lasts about a month with my kids) because of the weight put on the shoulders and upper back. DH can use it longer than I can, because he's stronger and larger.* There is some debate about facing the baby out and the stimulus received, but neither of my children minded much, probably because we mostly took quiet walks around the empty neighborhood, park, or around the house.* Also, some say it isn't great for hip development to hold babies by their crotches.",baby,review part round reviews baby carriers wife wrote including takes ergo baby carrier black camel lining stars theboba classic baby carrier glacier stars theinfantino ecosash baby carrier bloomin vines pounds stars theinfantino balance baby carrier spindles pounds stars general intro around lbs husband around lbs children seem grow quickly lbs months age good carrier vital health backs many features carrier try touch pros cons associated might say one feature benefit may also mention drawbacks vice versa differently tempered built babes toddlers differently shaped bodies different needs please take reviews worth humble opinions take bjorn dh loved carrier newest babies lbs pros holds close hanging loosely away depending babe likes tight pull straps become used fasteners super easy quick put even put one hand holding baby pre clipped spots easily adjustable mom dad sizing clip back arm straps keep carrier getting looser carry stiff supporting body keeps wee babes upright breathing passages open face position simple configure done without putting baby still wearing carrier cons like said loved carrier really babies pounds lasts month kids weight put shoulders upper back dh use longer stronger larger debate facing baby stimulus received neither children minded much probably mostly took quiet walks around empty neighborhood park around house also say great hip development hold babies crotches

"I started going to a new stylist a few months ago, and he uses this product on my hair.  The first time he used it, I loved it so much that I had to buy it!  I have a short, textured style, and this adds both texture and shine.Following my stylist's directions, I use one or two pumps of Cristalli Liquidi on my wet hair, which adds thickness and texture. I then add a small amount of pomade to my wet hair (I'm currently using D:Fi), and blow it dry.  After I've dried and flat-ironed my hair, I use some wax to piece out my hair, and then follow it up (as my last step) with one or two pumps of the Cristalli Liquidi again to add shine and texture.When you first get it, experiment a bit to make sure that you're using the right amount for your hair type and style.  I was worried that using the amount that my stylist recommended would leave my short hair greasy, but it doesn't at all.While the price is high on this product, it really is worth it.  I tend to use a lot of it (3-4 pumps a day), and the smaller .54 oz. bottle has lasted me about four months, which isn't too bad.

The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals, but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned, and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably, then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon, but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics, you can't go wrong here.",music,reason every mic cabinet least one great purpose dynamic mic use instruments vocals even field recording sometimes sm frequency response supposed tailored towards vocals mean handle voice pretty much mic far concerned average amateur recording engineer home studio practitioner think find thing operating level refuse use interchangeably probably already know looking getting add personal cabinet soon like wanted spend nice condenser filling dynamic mics go wrong

"This seat is exactly what I wanted. It's pretty durable and I feel comfortable with my son sitting on it. I think you have to remain realistic in your expectations when you are buying a potty seat that holds a child, yet folds small enough to put in your purse. The grip on the bottom is great, the handles are great, and it lips over the edge on the toilet enough that it protects hands from touching the toilet. I think it fits better on oblong toilets, which is what most public toilets are. If there is any down side, it would be the open part on the front...don't expect a splash guard. You will have to help a little boy point things down into the toilet. I don't find it to be a problem. The hole is not as big as a standard potty seat, so it might take a little assistance adjusting for what your child ""needs to do"" in the potty. It folds dirty side in and comes with a giant ziplock bag so you don't contaminate your purse. I keep a mini Lysol with me to spray it until I get home.

"After our daughter started to outgrow the Bjorn Synergy (which we absolutely loved!) at 8 or 9 months, I bought this one thinking it would give us some extra mileage and get us through another 6+ months or so. On the Bjorn site, they advertised that this product can support kids ""up to two years"". B.S., unless your kids is REALLY petite. At 18 pounds, it really strained my shoulders to carry her in it and at 23 pounds, it became nearly impossible to tolerate for more than 15 minutes at a time. I'm 5'6, 120 pounds and pretty fit, so its not a question of fitness level or strength, this design just isn't that great for larger babies. My husband also finds it pretty uncomfortable.We also own an Ergo, which is nice because it distributes the weight much better on the back and we can use it with our now 26lb girl, but annoying because my daughter isn't keen to be facing me instead of forward, facing the rest of the world. My last criticism of this Bjorn is that its really bulk and doesn't fold/condense well. We've taken it on the plane several times and it takes up a ton of room in our carry-on or diaper bag and doesn't fold well at all. Plus, as we live in a hot climate, it's just too warm. Unfortunately, I don't have a great product to suggest as an alternative, but I regret buying this thinking I could use it beyond 12 months.About the reviewers: We're admittedly hyperactive, type-A personalities and live for efficiency, function and ease in our daily lifestyles and will spend extra to get that.

"I'd have to agree with the other reviewers that the sauce definitely was fairly sweet and less so in terms of hotness. That's not to say it wasn't good... in fact, I loved the sauce but it just has a unique taste I can't really put my finger on.I tried it with some ground beef mixed in with the sauce (the extent of my cooking ability unfortunately) along with some saut&eacute;ed vegetables and was pleasantly surprised with the taste. It seems a bit too exotic for my normal cooking needs but I'm sure if you're trying to impress someone or if you're just looking to add a little flavor to your meals this sauce will do its job well.As others have said the bottle indicates it needs to be refrigerated after opening and seems to have a short expiration date from opening after that. It's somewhat unfortunate because I don't want to coat my meals with the stuff (since I live with two roommates who aren't exactly chefs themselves) but if you live in a large household I wouldn't imagine it being a real issue.It's a good sauce if you like the taste.

"The tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked, especially when I've been playing a lot.  The problem, at least for me, is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides, bends, and pull-offs less fluid.

Also, I sometimes use an Emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps, but I'd rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong.

I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.We tried to make the Fender/Shallers work but just could not.

No other cooking utensils or preparation is required. The metal rims on the containers do not cause sparking. Pretty neat.3. Ease of consumption. Just sip from the container, which seems to be a foam material or plastic that doesn't conduct much heat and is easy to hold. It fits easily into car cup holders. No spoons or bowls are required.Anyone on a low-salt diet should think twice. The soups have 30+ percent of the RDA. The fat content is a bit elevated. These things are to maintain the flavor.

"My wife and I run a cooking blog, so normally we make all our own sauces at home, but this looked tasty and we wanted something fast for an upcoming dinner and thought we'd try it. We weren't disappointed, as it's one of the better store bought sauces I've ever had, and much better than most canned or powder varieties.To use Campbell's marsala skillet sauce we diced up chicken breast and cooked in the oven, chopped some fresh mushrooms, and then tossed all the ingredients over Barilla multigrain spaghetti. There's plenty of other ways it would be great for a quick meal though, such as by using other pastas, meats, or chopped fresh veggies. Cooking some fresh garlic in the skillet prior to adding the sauce wouldn't hurt either, or you could splash in extra wine or cream if you want to just use the packet as a base to work off.On the portion front, a single packet was more than enough for two people, but if you're feeding a whole family you'll likely need two. If you want something a little different from the standard tomato, cream, or bean based sauces this is a great little diversion to try for dinner sometime soon.",grocery,wife run cooking blog normally make sauces home looked tasty wanted something fast upcoming dinner thought try disappointed one better store bought sauces ever much better canned powder varieties use campbell marsala skillet sauce diced chicken breast cooked oven chopped fresh mushrooms tossed ingredients barilla multigrain spaghetti plenty ways would great quick meal though using pastas meats chopped fresh veggies cooking fresh garlic skillet prior adding sauce hurt either could splash extra wine cream want use packet base work portion front single packet enough two people feeding whole family likely need two want something little different standard tomato cream bean based sauces great little diversion try dinner sometime soon
"When I gave this ball to my baby at 3mo. I was a little disappointed because he didn't seem very interested in it especially since he couldn't find a convenient way to put it in his mouth.

I think he's very interested in the rattling sound the inner ball makes, the red and blue colors of the ball, the different ""texture"" this toy has.He really likes to grab a hold of the little ""bars"" that make up the hexagons and he can really get a good grip on them at this age. This ball has also become a favorite motivational object to help him crawl.

"It's not rare for me to try a food product through the Vine program that I think is good, but it's not common for me to like one so much that it changes my normal routine.  This did!  I really enjoy this tea.I think that this has a really good mix of spice and sweetness.  I drank a few cups with nothing added and loved it, and then I tried the suggestion on the box and added some milk to it - delicious!  The milk helps to smooth it out, but it's not necessary at all.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to you to try.I do have a couple of notes, though:1.

The plastic walls of the k-cups are thinner than others that I've used (and I've been using them for seven years).  In my k-cup brewer, this hasn't caused any problems.

If you use that, you need to be careful when you insert these, and I highly recommend puncturing the bottom first.  The first one that I tried just crushed when I tried to insert it, so I do open a small hole on the bottom first and then insert it slowly.

"After having played the Yamaha YPG-535 88-key Portable Grand Piano Keyboard in a showroom and loving it, I was torn, wondering what all I would be missing out on if I went with the more economically priced YPG-235. I now own the 235 and it appears as if I am missing out on twelve keys. That is, I am not experiencing even an ounce of buyer's remorse after opting for the cheaper 235. This is a lovely keyboard with more beautiful voices than I will ever know what to do with and extremely user friendly functionality. Of course, my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt as I will be the first to admit that my experience with other products of this variety is extremely limited. As such, it might be best to say that, for a novice, one could not ask for a better instrument for the price.So what is the difference between the 235 and the 535? Based on my previous comparative shopping, I have come up with a few differences. First is the obvious fact that the 535 possesses 88 keys, while the 235 has 76. The 535 also includes a stand, sustain pedal, and power adapter, which must be purchased separately for the 235. While I am unaware of the specifics, the 535 also has greater storage capacity and capability as well as a few more voices. Beyond these definitive differences, having now played both models, the 535 also wins out with regard to aesthetics in that it looks and feels to be of a slightly higher quality, from its display to the apparent craftsmanship in assembly.Why buy the YPG-235? If price is not an issue, go ahead and get he 535, it is a beautiful instrument. However, for those on a budget or for those who simply do not need 88 keys, purchase the 235. Like the 535, the 235 possesses piano style Graded Soft Touch (GST) keys, which are not exactly weighted but occupy that perfect gap between pure synth keys and weighted. The feel is perfect for one who is used to standard synth-style keyboard keys yet longs for a little more control without sacrificing playability. The 235, like the 535, also features USB connectivity and general MIDI compatibility, as well as almost all of the same high quality voices, which separate both the 535 and the 235 from many other models in their price brackets (besides the pianos, the multitude of stringed instrument voices are amazingly realistic). While it is unfortunate that Yamaha decided to not include a power adapter with the 235, theYamaha Survival Kit D - Accessory Kit for Yamaha YPG-235 & YPG-235 Keyboardswhich includes a power adaptor, extended warranty, and a couple of other low quality extras can be purchased relatively cheaply. In my opinion, the YPG-235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck. Again, the 235 sounds great, feels great and is hard to beat for the price!",music,played yamaha ypg key portable grand piano keyboard showroom loving torn wondering would missing went economically priced ypg appears missing twelve keys experiencing even ounce buyer remorse opting cheaper lovely keyboard beautiful voices ever know extremely user friendly functionality course opinion taken grain salt first admit experience products variety extremely limited might best say novice one could ask better instrument price difference based previous comparative shopping come differences first obvious fact possesses keys also includes stand sustain pedal power adapter must purchased separately unaware specifics also greater storage capacity capability well voices beyond definitive differences played models also wins regard aesthetics looks feels slightly higher quality display apparent craftsmanship assembly buy ypg price issue go ahead get beautiful instrument however budget simply need keys purchase like possesses piano style graded soft touch gst keys exactly weighted occupy perfect gap pure synth keys weighted feel perfect one used standard synth style keyboard keys yet longs little control without sacrificing playability like also features usb connectivity general midi compatibility well almost high quality voices separate many models price brackets besides pianos multitude stringed instrument voices amazingly realistic unfortunate yamaha decided include power adapter theyamaha survival kit accessory kit yamaha ypg ypg keyboardswhich includes power adaptor extended warranty couple low quality extras purchased relatively cheaply opinion ypg offers buyer bang comparative buck sounds great feels great hard beat price

"I love chili dishes of all kinds.  This chili powder has a nice rounded flavor. It tastes quite mild to me.  It makes a great base for a milder chili dish. But if a person wants more heat, that can be achieved with additional chipotles, cumin, cayenne or a variety of fresh peppers for additional heat and character.  It's all up to the cook how the dish ends up.Whether you prefer mild chili dishes (or like me) plenty of heat, this is a great spice base and the large jar is an excellent value. If you like heat, keep cans of chipotle peppers or chiplotle powder for 'customizing"".I will definitely purchase again.NOTE: I've been using this for a few months now and still pleased with flavor,results and cost. it's a good base spice for many dishes.

"I wasn't sure about spending a lot of money on a guitar since I was just starting out.  I bought this to work with Rocksmith 2014 and it did the job just fine.  The guitar needed some work to get it properly set up since tuning it straight out of the box sounded horrible.  It turns out that the intonation needed to be set properly and also the strings that it came with are garbage.I put new strings on it and fixed the intonation, adjusted the truss rod a bit and adjusted the string height (all with just the tools that they provided with the guitar) and it sounded a lot better. Unfortunately there's no 22nd fret on this guitar.  That probably shouldn't come as a big surprise as a lot of stratocaster type guitars only have 21 frets, but there's this one song that requires me to bend the high e string on the 22nd fret...The single coil pickups have quite a bit of hum on them so for rocksmith you kinda have to calibrate it a few times to make sure that it doesn't pick up much of that hum, or else you resort to using the 2nd and 4th switch setting so that it uses two pickups at once which cancels out the hum.I think if you wanted to try modding your guitar this would probably be a decent choice too.  I haven't gotten that far yet.  I've had it since February, changed strings on it twice (in 4 months) and so far it's proven to be a fairly nice little guitar to learn on...except for that 22nd fret (oh well).",music,sure spending lot money guitar since starting bought work rocksmith job fine guitar needed work get properly set since tuning straight box sounded horrible turns intonation needed set properly also strings came garbage put new strings fixed intonation adjusted truss rod bit adjusted string height tools provided guitar sounded lot better unfortunately nd fret guitar probably come big surprise lot stratocaster type guitars frets one song requires bend high e string nd fret single coil pickups quite bit hum rocksmith kinda calibrate times make sure pick much hum else resort using nd th switch setting uses two pickups cancels hum think wanted try modding guitar would probably decent choice gotten far yet since february changed strings twice months far proven fairly nice little guitar learn except nd fret oh well

In between is a chewy, Rice Krispie-like bar sprinkled with peanut butter flavored chips to complete the package.  As a bonus you get 4 grams each of protein and fiber.

"Kellogg's is trying very hard to advertise their strawberry fruit snacks as being healthy.  They have named them Harvest Acres Fruit Snacks and depicted caricatures of a windmill, barn and fruit trees on the cardboard box that appears to be manufactured from recycled materials.  The terms ""Natural Flavors"" and ""Made With Real Fruit"" are also provided in large letters.However, the box also says, ""Fruit Flavored Snacks.""  Look at the ingredients; you will see that the main ones are corn syrup and sugar, and each serving contains 2% OR LESS of real fruit juice, none of which are strawberry.  (""Natural strawberry flavor"" is listed as an ingredient.)  There are 10 0.8 ounce pouches; each pouch is a serving.  Each serving is 70 calories consisting mostly of 12 grams of sugar and less than 1 gram of protein.It is safe to say that this fruit snack from Kellogg's is not healthy.  However, despite the misleading advertising, I still gave the fruit snack a very high rating.  Why?  Because these are the most powerful, best tasting gummy fruit snacks that I have ever had.  I am not surprised since they were produced by Kellogg's, which has a reputation for having the greatest cereals and fruit bars on the market.In the future, I definitely plan to buy Kellogg's Harvest Acres Fruit Snacks.

"I just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home. It does the job well. If you're looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio, then, it's perfect. Many adjustments to get just the right position. It's definitely not a performance mic, as it does feel a bit filmsy, but, you won't notice the flimsiness except for when you're adjusting it. Adjusting it is a tad tedious, but, you can get a really good position with the microphone after a couple minutes.I've mounted my Samson Q1U Dynamic Cardioid USB microphone to it. It works well for sure. Then, I attached the standard pop filter, and the microphone started tipping it over. Make sure the boom is aligned with a leg extension, or it will tip over if there's too much weight.

"Background:I'm a gear-head, with an affection for pedals and always looking for amps that take them well.  Before my current set-up, I played a Fender Strat run through my effects into a Vox AC15.  The Vox sounded great but I had two problems: 1 - The all tube amp made me worry that my amp could crap out in the middle of a gig. 2 - At 15 watts, even though it was loud, I'd often have to crank my amp to keep up with the rest of the band, and as the tube amp increased, so did it's natural gain.  That would normally be sweet, but it would color my effects with a different tone, and often times leave me having feedback issues.Enter the Fender Frontman 212R!This thing has TONS of clean headroom, and it seems like it was built for pedals.  I can crank the amp or keep it quiet, and there is no tone changes done to my effects.  This is a benefit of a solid state amp with high wattage and lots of clean headroom.  It makes it easy to dial in your sound every time, no matter what volume you play at.Secondly, it's Fender reliable (with a 5 year warranty).  No tubes means no tube issues.  Yes, it doesn't sound as good as the Vox by itself, but that's why I have pedals.Other things worth mentioning:It's not as heavy as my Vox (all tube) amp.

"I got one of these with my first pregnancy, and loved it. It is cushy enough to be soft and cuddly, but still gives support where your aching body needs it. During my current pregnancy, I started having a lot more hip pain and thought I needed to try a full body support pillow. It was a total waste. Way too bulky, and not even uncomfortable. I needed more support for my back, hips, and belly, not something awkward for my neck with little to no support where I needed it most. I ended up ordering a second one of these cuddle pillows, and it was an amazing decision. I use one to support my belly and one for my back, and have been sleeping well that way for months (even still, while huge at 37 weeks). I am so glad I got these.As a side note, the other thing I remember using this for after my last pregnancy was to put under my arm when I was rocking my daughter. It made it perfectly comfortable to sit and hold her for (literally!) hours.

I'm a bigger guy, so a smaller person shouldn't have this problem. Then there's the whole friction of suede on clothing thing I hadn't considered.

"I've used D'Addario strings for many, many years without problems - both acoustic & electric.  I've tried these coated strings in the past, and I actually prefer them to Elixir because they feel more like regular strings - the wrap is coated, rather than a sheathe being placed over the entire string, like on Elixirs.Do they last longer?  Probably.  Even when I'm in situations where I'm gigging regularly I rarely change strings more than every few months, just because I don't see the need.  I think the main benefit to coated strings is if you have guitars that you can't play regularly the strings won't corrode.  But these sound great and feel fine, and the're the least expensive coated strings I've found.  I've always found D'Addario quality to be great.",music,used addario strings many many years without problems acoustic electric tried coated strings past actually prefer elixir feel like regular strings wrap coated rather sheathe placed entire string like elixirs last longer probably even situations gigging regularly rarely change strings every months see need think main benefit coated strings guitars play regularly strings corrode sound great feel fine least expensive coated strings found always found addario quality great

"I have tried Gopicnic before and it took awhile to get grow accustomed to their style, but over time I have grown to love their variety.  Gopicnic is a company that takes pride in the quality of their food choices.  No MSG, no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup - is the stated motto.  Their packages are not entirely organic, but heavily organic with all natural products included.  I would say that they are a vegetarian friendly company, but not necessarily 100% vegan products (maybe more like 60-70%).  I will give you a break down of each item, it's size, and my thoughts on it.  Note: this package breakdown is not necessarily guaranteed to be that way from now on.  Occasionally companies like Gopicnic substitute products & flavors based on availability.""What's in the box!""1. 5 oz box of Late July Organic Mini Cheddar Cheese sandwich crackers.  Very tasty, one of my favorites of this package.2. 5 oz bag of Mrs May's Original All Natural Cashew Crunch.  This has the crunch of a lightly salted snack and the slight sweetness of a candy - great combination and very filling.3. 6 oz bag of Pretzel Crisps All Natural Cinnamon Toast pretzel snacks.  This was the surprise hit of the box, great low fat snack.4. 4 packets of 0.3 oz Emergen-C Raspberry Flavored drink mix.  This tasted a little less like a drink & more like a vitamin supplement.  But it was very healthy and easy to add to bottled water.5. 2.4 oz Oatmeal Raisin Walnut Clif Bar.  A very dense and hearty energy bar.  This is great for a 10g protein balance to this package.6. 1.58 oz Sharkies Organic Watermelon Scream sports chews.  Think of it as a sports energy drink put in a gummy bear.  Awesome.7. 6.2 oz can of St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go Three Beans with Sweetcorn.  Doesn't sound or look appetizing, but surprisingly it was very filling and pretty good.  The biggest plus, does not need cooking and comes with it's own fork.8. 6.1 oz box of Gopicnic Peanut Butter & Crackers ready-to-eat meal.  This contained a 1 oz package of 80% Organic Annie's Cheddar Bunnies, a 0.7 oz package of Late July Organic Classic Rich crackers, a 0.5 oz packet of Peanut Butter & Co Smooth Operator Natural Peanut Butter, a 3 oz cup of Sweet Perry Orchards All-Natural Unsweetened Applesauce, a 0.9 oz packet of Surf Sweets All Natural Gummy Bears, and a spork.As you can see, there is a wide variety of items and the focus is on health-conscious eating.  I think the box would be great for hiking, biking, camping, etc. - not just studying.  There are a few great activity foods, like the Clif Bar & Sharkies that are excellent for outdoor enthusiasts.  The other items are easy for a stop-along-the-trail lunch.  I can say that of these items most are in minimum packaging, making the trash a small issue on the trail.  You could probably feed four for a snack, but would only make 1-2 people a realistically balanced meal.  Many items in this package are one serving, while others are 5-6 so you may have difficulty on portions of the more protein heavy items - Clif Bar / canned bean corn.

"The Rain Forest Healthy Care Booster Seat is an ideal product for Grandma's house, for those with smaller homes and limited space for baby items, and for travelling.  It can be used on most full-sized dining chairs and can be left in place, if necessary, so that storage does not become an problem.This is an excellent item for individuals who need to have a highchair handy for grandchildren or visitors, but who do not want a full-sized highchair taking up valuable living space.  Individuals living in apartments or smaller homes, and who have a small to average sized infant may find it useful as a space saver.  Those who frequently visit friends and want to have a highchair available for feeding will find this very portable and easy to attach and detach from a regularly sized dining room or kitchen chair.The drawbacks associated with the booster seat are several.  Larger children may not be able to use this product for any extended period of time.  A 21 pound, 28 inch tall infant has about 1 inch clearance between the tray and himself when the tray is in the most forward position.  He is six months old and this is the first time that he has been able to use the chair.  The chair is not particularly sturdy, although I do not think it would qualify as being flimsy.  The tray snaps onto a protruding button and pulls off; a larger, older toddler might easily be able to disengage the tray.  Finally, this is somewhat expensive when evaluated against its useful life.  Those who have the room for a larger, regularly designed highchair would be advised to go that route.All in all, the Rainforest Booster seat is a good product and has valuable uses in certain circumstances.",baby,rain forest healthy care booster seat ideal product grandma house smaller homes limited space baby items travelling used full sized dining chairs left place necessary storage become problem excellent item individuals need highchair handy grandchildren visitors want full sized highchair taking valuable living space individuals living apartments smaller homes small average sized infant may find useful space saver frequently visit friends want highchair available feeding find portable easy attach detach regularly sized dining room kitchen chair drawbacks associated booster seat several larger children may able use product extended period time pound inch tall infant inch clearance tray tray forward position six months old first time able use chair chair particularly sturdy although think would qualify flimsy tray snaps onto protruding button pulls larger older toddler might easily able disengage tray finally somewhat expensive evaluated useful life room larger regularly designed highchair would advised go route rainforest booster seat good product valuable uses certain circumstances

"I purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive Epiphone Les Paul Jr, which fits perfectly (as does a Squier Strat.)On the plus side, the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some (but not a lot) of abuse.The reason I claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear. That should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this. One other issue I've had with the case is I left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges, especially the lip around the top of the case. Again, this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot, enclosed space for prolonged periods.For inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument. It is perfect for occasional gigging, but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road. I would not hesitate to purchase another one if I acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because I do like the better protection this particular case provides.",music,purchased mine protect relatively inexpensive epiphone les paul jr fits perfectly squier strat plus side price makes attractive alternative soft gig bags market getting rigid case take lot abuse reason claimed case provide basic protection top side strength protect instrument stack heavy equipment case packing gear problem detract value long aware one issue case left car hot day tolex covering started lifting edges especially lip around top case problem long aware leave case hot enclosed space prolonged periods inexpensive guitars ideal case provide protection instrument perfect occasional gigging would probably withstand rigors road would hesitate purchase another one acquired guitar soft gig bag like better protection particular case provides

"These sacks are everything the reviews promised they would be. I bought them for the baby I am expecting in a few months but broke into them to clean up after my dog's puppy pads (when his diaper genie 2 ran out of bags). We already knew we didn't want to use a diaper genie for our baby since it has been so ineffective for our dog's pads- and we only put one in a day (he's indoor and outdoor trained) but we continued to use it for him because it was better than smelling it in the garbage. Using the sassy sacks for 2 days has made a huge difference. We can throw away the pad in a sassy sack into a regular trash can and there is no smell. I can also take these with me on dog walks to pick up poops along the way.I am so pleased using these for my dog, I can't wait to use them for the baby!

"My dermatologist told me to wear sun screen every day whether I am hiking outdoors or driving my car to work if I want to avoid additional sun spots pigmentation (or worse!) This sun screen is the kind that you can wear every day even to the office where you might want to put a bit of make up on top of the sunscreen. Good make up application does not look like you have make it just makes you look better, but other sunscreen I have used tend to attract make up like blush it makes it noticeable. This sun block does not.

SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor and it means that means you can stay in the sun 40 times longer than without sunscreen without getting burned. My dermatologist recommended reapplying sunblock every 2 hours when I am outside to avoid skin damage which results in the dark spots.By a lucky coincidence I received an offer to test Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen a week before laser surgery to remove my sun spots, and now I am so pleased to have discovered it.

"I couldn't be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on Amazon. This was a newly listed item on Amazon when I bought it, (in fact this review will be the first), so I was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback, but I'm glad I decided on this item.I wanted something with several storage compartments, so I could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly. This bag has six separate compartments for storage - three main zipped compartments, each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items. Perfect! I also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled, as well as a guitar strap that I don't currently require as I already have one, but it's nice to have a spare now.The padding of the bag is quite thin, but firm, so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying. The two built in ""back-pack"" straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage, and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes to.If you are in the market for a guitar bag and don't want to spend a fortune, I would definitely recommend you consider this item.

"I bought this crib because of its great reviews on Consumer Reports and got the matching mattress because I figured that because they match there won't be a fit issue. WRONG! A few weeks after my son started to sleep in it, I noticed a 1.25"" gap on the left/right side of the crib between the mattress and the crib slats. I wrote an email to the company and showed them photos of this gap. Their solution? They sent me ANOTHER Emily crib. Well, my husband I put it together to discover (gasp!) it still had a 1.25"" gap!! I emailed the company again and got a phone call from one of their product managers. He looked up the measurements of the crib and told me that there's a certain allowable gap between the mattress and crib and the Emily crib is on the higher end of the allowable gap size. I have to admit, Million Dollar Baby did a great job with customer service. He apologized that there was a gap and offered me their Kalani bed instead for free, which does not have a gap according to the crib measurements. However, with one crib upstairs and another disassembled downstairs, I wasn't about to have them send me a third crib! So I declined. They had FedEx pick up the crib they sent over. Bottom line: know that this crib will have a gap with the Emily mattress. I stuffed three rolled up receiving blankets in the gap, just in case. Although I love the crib--the design, the sturdiness--I am disappointed to find out about this gap. I was always under the impression that the mattress should fit snugly on all sides in the crib.

"Waited two months before reviewing my les paul 100 to make sure there were no issues.  I am very happy with the guitar.  It came well padded and was in excellent shape.  It was set up well and has played well out of the box.  Just did my first string change making sure I used the same gauge of string and didn't have to make any adjustments to the guitar.  Played as well after the change as it did before.  Was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and it's a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances.  Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play, free prime two day shipping, no sales tax, and saved about $80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store.  The savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new Mustang 2 v2 amplifier.The only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box.  This one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer.

"7/12/2012: It saddens me to say this, but we've been told that our son is trying to walk on his toes instead of flat footed because of the jumper use from an early age. He still LOVES this jumper, but because of what we've been told by the PED, we can't recommend it and won't be using it any longer. If we had to do it over, we would have used an excersaucer until he could walk unsupported, then let him use the jumper. I hate to discourage anyone because not every child will have this issue, but it does happen and we are the unfortunate people it happened too.5/1/2012: Our son is nearly 10 months and still loves this jumper. He has figured out everything and knows how to use each item, but he doesn't seem bored in it yet. He loves the ability to jump. We've tried 2 other jumpers and they didn't work for him. This jumper is by far his favorite. I would strongly recommend this jumper as it is (1) easy to clean, (2) easy to adjust the height, (3) easy to move around the house (but doesn't fit through standard bedroom door frames), and (4) easy to pull the baby in and out.

Of course, as an orchestra light, it couldn't be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose, I am just pointing out that I feel it isn't worth 40 dollars, when you consider the whole field of similar lights (those not intended for orchestra).I bought this because of reputation and reviews, but it should probably cost the same as its closest competitor, theRechargeable Music Stand LED Light Clip-on 9 LEDS with Adapter.

"I ordered this bench for last Christmas (2005). I'm satisfied so far. Good value for money.The seat is generously padded and is 2.5 inches thick. Padding material is not too soft, and that is good in my opinion.All-steel frame construction feels sturdy.Contrary to one of the reviews, my bench came with height adjustment (it is not on-the-fly kind of thing, though). Each of the legs has 3 holes (low, middle, high). A fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs, and the bolt becomes the crossing point of ""X"". Three positions roughly correspond to 18, 19 and 20 inches.For changing height, all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt, insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it. Don't worry, you don't need any tool to do the job,  thanks to a large plastic knob. See the picture and you'll understand how it works.Mine initially came with middle position. I also tried high and low, but set it back to middle. It seems to be a good compromise for my family, as the bench is used daily by me, my wife and my kids. Sure it's nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily.

"The first thing I do when Iam trying or thinking about trying a new product is look at the ingredients, at least I can do that in a store, where I can see the product up close.  Online you may get the general idea, which is open to interpretation.I've never had an energy drink before, or any energy product besides 5 hour energy.  With that, which I have only tried that once, was if I drank the whole bottle, tho it is small it may have given me energy, but I didn't feel very good, until it wore off.This product, No Fear, which I had to turn the can around to even see what it was called, it's a 16 ounce can, which is supposed to be 2 servings.  On the front of the can it says super energy supplement.I took a few sips.  It tastes like grapefruit, so the taste isn't bad.  It's kind of refreshing.Then I read the ingredients on the back of the can.  What I saw amazed me!!Calorie wise it's 130 calories, but what really surprised me is the amount of carbohydrates, it's 34 grams, but the sugar is 33 grams, and both of those are for ONE serving!I wonder if the real energy you are getting is because of all of the sugar that is in this product!The caffeine level is 87 mg's, so I don't know how much that computes to when you are considering the amount of caffeine, what differentiates a high caffeine level versus a low caffeine level.  I suspect that this drink is on the higher end of the spectrum as far as the caffeine level.I just wonder if the can shows it's for 2 servings, what if you don't want to drink the whole can at once, which is 16 ounces?  If you saved the other half of the can, just like soda, which first has fizz when you open the can, if you have some left over it won't have the fizz.Iam really not sure who would want to drink this product or why, but for me, just the amount of carbohydrates and sugars would make this a drink I could never consider drinking.At least for me, this is NOT a healthy drink!  Maybe if your main concern is having more energy it may not matter to you, but at what cost?I would be curious to see how someone would feel who had drank this whole can of No Fear.What they should fear is getting diabetes, especially if they drank this on a regular basis!",grocery,first thing iam trying thinking trying new product look ingredients least store see product close online may get general idea open interpretation never energy drink energy product besides hour energy tried drank whole bottle tho small may given energy feel good wore product fear turn around even see called ounce supposed servings front says super energy supplement took sips tastes like grapefruit taste bad kind refreshing read ingredients back saw amazed calorie wise calories really surprised amount carbohydrates grams sugar grams one serving wonder real energy getting sugar product caffeine level mg know much computes considering amount caffeine differentiates high caffeine level versus low caffeine level suspect drink higher end spectrum far caffeine level wonder shows servings want drink whole ounces saved half like soda first fizz open left fizz iam really sure would want drink product amount carbohydrates sugars would make drink could never consider drinking least healthy drink maybe main concern energy may matter cost would curious see someone would feel drank whole fear fear getting diabetes especially drank regular basis

"I bought one at Walmart yesterday for two-fifty a packet when they were featured as a new item.  These are flavorful and a tad on the spicy side thanks to the chili powder and garlic salt, but it's mostly rice and corn inside.  That is the real ""stuffing"" as there wasn't much chicken although it's listed as the second ingredient after rice.  All you do is cut open the bag and zap it in the microwave for up to two minutes, then squeeze the contents over an open tortilla.  It makes for a quick, tasty meal.Don't get me wrong, though, I liked the content.  One bag yields two small burritos although the bag says it's a serving for five people at 90 calories each.  Yeah right! That equates to 1/3 cup or 55g, so those two burritos on the package must be really small.It's a bit on the dry side, although there's enough spice to satisfy your craving for something a tad on the hot side.One serving has 5mg of cholesterol, 380 mg of sodium, 13g of carbs and 4g of protein.I bought a package yesterday.  The expiration date given was 28 April 2012.Contains soyI'd rate this higher if it weren't for the high price here.  At the current given price that comes to seven forty seven a packet.

"Just got this today and I'm experiencing serious install issues. Please note that I'm not a newbie to this stuff. I'm an IT guy. I have a new Acer computer that's less than 3 months old with a new install of Windows 7. The mic is recognized, but not as a sound input device, just as an ""Other USB Device"". I tried installing it on another laptop and it installed quickly and easily, so it's not that the mic itself doesn't work.My purpose in posting this is to let people considering this mic know that you can't just assume that the install is a no-brain'r (at least not on a PC). The Samson tech support was friendly enough, but not very helpful. They had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support. The support guy said, ""well, that's really all there is to it"", which I can understand...but I still have a $70 mic that won't work with my computer. I tried contacting Microsoft tech support and they tried to help me too, but we could never get the mic to be seen as an input device. We tried it a number of ways and nothing worked.I ordered this for use with my iPad as well, and I ordered the ""camera kit"" to do so. Despite what I'd seen in the reviews and videos online, the mic I received would work not with that either. The Mic needs to be powered by the iPad and it seemed mine was not getting enough power from the iPad because the little indicator light was still Amber when plugged in (indicating it's not getting enough power) instead of Blue.I tried this on my wife's iPad and my daughter's too so it would not appear to be the iPad that is the problem (though it could be the camera connector, I suppose.)So...I ended up returning the whole shooting match.

"I liked this kit because mushrooms are really neat fungi that I like picking and eating.  The most important thing about mushrooming is knowing what is safe.  Either you absolutely know a mushroom is safe to eat or you treat it like poison.  An oyster mushroom kit is a nice way to get to know oyster mushrooms.  Add another to the safe list.I'm glad I read some reviews of this kit before use.  Basically, you have to soak the substrate for at least a day.  After that, be sure to add enough water to keep the substrate damp.  I live in a desert climate, misting won't do the job.  Also, a little common sense helps.  Mushrooms like the dark.  A shady spot in a room that gets lots of sunlight is probably too bright.  Try that dingy back room.I tested this kit in the summer during the monsoon season.  That means there was a little humidity in the air.  The temperature was high 70's to low 80's.  The mushrooms did sprout and there was a nice little clump of them.  Something to know about mushrooms - harvest by cutting the stems and do it promptly.  Many mushrooms don't like to stay around long.  Also, if they are outside they quickly become homes for critters.As for taste, these are OK.  I don't know that it's possible to grow truly flavorful mushrooms in anything but nice loamy dirt.  These ones were just fine in spaghetti sauce and cooked in a pan of garlicy butter goodness.  Note: I have no idea what people mean when they say these things taste ""nutty.""",grocery,liked kit mushrooms really neat fungi like picking eating important thing mushrooming knowing safe either absolutely know mushroom safe eat treat like poison oyster mushroom kit nice way get know oyster mushrooms add another safe list glad read reviews kit use basically soak substrate least day sure add enough water keep substrate damp live desert climate misting job also little common sense helps mushrooms like dark shady spot room gets lots sunlight probably bright try dingy back room tested kit summer monsoon season means little humidity air temperature high low mushrooms sprout nice little clump something know mushrooms harvest cutting stems promptly many mushrooms like stay around long also outside quickly become homes critters taste ok know possible grow truly flavorful mushrooms anything nice loamy dirt ones fine spaghetti sauce cooked pan garlicy butter goodness note idea people mean say things taste nutty

Tunes by sensing the vibration of the instrument, not using a microphone, so you can tune even if it is noisy. And any pedals, effects, amps, etc in the setup do not affect the tone, you are tuning the actual resonance of the string. Even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well.

"I used my Moby Wrap all the time with my first son (now 21 months) when he was a newborn, and now I'm using it with my second baby.

(You don't need to take the whole thing off to remove the kid, as you do with some wraps.) This is also handy in the winter, as you can just keep your Moby on under your coat; put baby in it, button or zip up, and you're good to go!* The two-shouldered support is really nice. I love ring slings, but I find that I can wear a wrap or other two-shouldered carrier for MUCH longer without getting uncomfortable.* You can hold baby in a variety of positions -- facing out, facing in, on your back, etc. The wrap comes with a color booklet explaining how to do all of these holds in great detail; I found it extremely helpful.* The moss color is great! It's both mom- and dad-friendly, and it doesn't show pet hair :)The cons:* The material IS very stretchy, so as your baby gets bigger (and heavier), you'll need to find another carrier.* It can be a bit of a pain to put on and take off (as my mother-in-law said, ""That looks elaborate!""), and it's not the most gorgeous carrier in the world.

I love the little mesh pockets inside the seat to place sippy cups and toys. And I even love the color, Appletree! I also really like the yellow. (like a golden yellow, not overly bright) Very cute!Obviously, this is a little bigger than your typical umbrella stroller. It folds down nicely, (about 1/3 of the size of my Cortina) but not as small and compact as a normal umbrella stroller. but since most umbrella strollers hardly give you a basket and their canopy is a joke, I think the Joovy offers the best of both worlds.Their cup holder is a little wobbly, but I can fit my water bottle in there fine. Their zipper pocket is nice to keep first aid kit and keys. Not huge, but enough room for the essentials.the only cons were that I wish there was a bar or tray to put snacks on, but there are plenty of after market add-ons that offer good options. the handles don't telescope out, but that hasn't become a problem between me or my husband. (he's 6') Also the latch to close the stroller was a little too small and was difficult to snap on. its a bendable plastic latch, so I used a knife to open the hole a little more to make it easier to latch.Otherwise definitely worth it!!",baby,market extra stroller similar chicco cortina travel system using without weight bulk needed stroller good size canopy big basket comfy ride joovy stroller love glides push super smooth ride little girl grips nice foam rubber nice comfy hands canopy huge gives great coverage nice peek boo window even undo velcro top pull way forward walking sun still hitting face reflective areas stroller easy see night although seat recline way flat found comfortable daughter take nap love little mesh pockets inside seat place sippy cups toys even love color appletree also really like yellow like golden yellow overly bright cute obviously little bigger typical umbrella stroller folds nicely size cortina small compact normal umbrella stroller since umbrella strollers hardly give basket canopy joke think joovy offers best worlds cup holder little wobbly fit water bottle fine zipper pocket nice keep first aid kit keys huge enough room essentials cons wish bar tray put snacks plenty market add ons offer good options handles telescope become problem husband also latch close stroller little small difficult snap bendable plastic latch used knife open hole little make easier latch otherwise definitely worth

"I introduced this piano to my now 3 month old daughter - who was too young to really play with any toys yet, but who already loved to kick - a couple weeks ago. It took a few tries of me taking her foot and pressing the keys for her before she started being able to do it on her own, but oh wow, does she LOVE it now! I can put her in her pack n play (with a activity bar across top with some links and a dangling toy) for up to 20-30min and she will just sit there and entertain herself, kicking the piano and swatting at the toys (she can't quite grab them yet). This is the first toy she's been able to interact with and it's so much fun just watching and/or listening to her play with it.Unlike other reviews, I don't find the sound to be too quiet at all and usually keep the volume on the quieter option too.

Plus, because our nursery doubles as our office, I can often send a few emails or even make a call or two with the sound of the piano quietly in the background.I'm really glad we got this off our registry - it's so much fun to see my daughter start to interact with things! :)",baby,introduced piano month old daughter young really play toys yet already loved kick couple weeks ago took tries taking foot pressing keys started able oh wow love put pack n play activity bar across top links dangling toy min sit entertain kicking piano swatting toys quite grab yet first toy able interact much fun watching listening play unlike reviews find sound quiet usually keep volume quieter option babies need loud noises order play something plus nursery doubles office often send emails even make call two sound piano quietly background really glad got registry much fun see daughter start interact things

"I compared this side by side with two other reverbs-1) The Boss '63 Fender reverb2) The Electro Harmonix Holy Grail.I found the EH- Holy Grail the most natural sounding and the simplest to operate with only 1 knob and one switch.The TC pedal did sound nice, but to my ears slightly sterile by comparison to the Holy Grail.I thought the Boss pedal sounded pretty bad.Pros of the pedal:- several settings and with all the knobs, highly adjustable- mono or stero (2 inputs, 2 outputs)- standard 9 volt power supply jack used by most pedals- I liked the spring reverb, and the ""mod"" reverb which was lush.Cons:- Sounded a little sterile compared to EH Holy Grail, but close and still good- I thought the number of different reverb settings was actually overkill and just there to look like it did a lot. To my ears, the rest were less distinctive.-Priced at $150, seemed a little high although I know there are other pedals that cost more.Overall a nice pedal, I can't really ding it for the cons above so I still gave it 5 stars.

"I got this an extra seat so my daughter could ride in our second car without us having to move the Britax Marathon, which can be kind of a pain. She's tall enough for it and just meets the weight requirement. She seems to fit in it well. When my son needed a booster a few years ago, the Britax models were too narrow for him. My daughter is slender compared to him and I think that is why this seat is a good fit for her.It was simple to assemble by sliding the back on the base and snapping it in place. It is lightweight and easy to put in the car. The padding is comfortable and the pattern is very nice. It has two arm rests, but they are short and a bit too low for my daughter to use. She does really like the cup holders. There is one on each side, so if you have a car seat next to this booster and it blocks the holder on that side, you can use the other. They are difficult for my daughter to pull out though if she is already seated; she pulls them out before climbing in. Her other complaint is that the slide guard bothers her legs.

"In our travels, my wife and I have found that newer hotels usually have larger bathrooms with ample space on the vanity for all our meds, toiletries, shaver, etc. That's often not the case, though, especially with older hostelries. For that reason, my wife, who travels with a lot more stuff than I do, always carries a fold-up hanging bag for her things.After examining the Davidsbeenhere bag, she claimed it for herself and gave me her old one, no discussion necessary. Nevertheless, I asked her why she preferred this bag over her old one, and she gave me her reasons:1. It's very lightweight, which matters on flying trips, where overweight bags cost plenty of extra fees. (I weighed it, and it came in at 8 ounces.)2. Folded up, it's very compact, but hung up on the back of a door or in a closet, it's surprisingly spacious, with more than enough room for most people's needs.3. It has enough separate compartments to separate different items into their own area (toothpaste and toothbrush, shampoo and conditioner, prescription meds, OTC meds, cosmetics, etc.4. The synthetic fabric and mesh are lightweight, but appear to be very tough and durable.5. The steel hanging hook is the right size for hanging on a doorknob or shower curtain rod, and it's securely sewn into a fabric-reinforced part of the bag.6. The carrying handle is big enough for just about anyone's hands, and it's securely sewn into the bag.So my wife is very happy to have a new toiletries bag that she loves, while I make do with her old one.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for an honest review.",beauty,travels wife found newer hotels usually larger bathrooms ample space vanity meds toiletries shaver etc often case though especially older hostelries reason wife travels lot stuff always carries fold hanging bag things examining davidsbeenhere bag claimed gave old one discussion necessary nevertheless asked preferred bag old one gave reasons lightweight matters flying trips overweight bags cost plenty extra fees weighed came ounces folded compact hung back door closet surprisingly spacious enough room people needs enough separate compartments separate different items area toothpaste toothbrush shampoo conditioner prescription meds otc meds cosmetics etc synthetic fabric mesh lightweight appear tough durable steel hanging hook right size hanging doorknob shower curtain rod securely sewn fabric reinforced part bag carrying handle big enough anyone hands securely sewn bag wife happy new toiletries bag loves make old one product sample provided manufacturer honest review

"Time will tell if they last longer than strings 1/3rd the price. Visually, they don't appear any different than cheaper Bronze wound strings. I was expecting something different, but as far as sound goes, the strings tuned well and only required some stretching 3 times to get them to stay in tune, even after playing &#34;smear notes&#34; on several songs. My problem with cheaper strings (De'Angelo) was they would tarnish or rust quickly, the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar. The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer. I'll know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not. Since these are literally triple the cost, I'll know if it was worth the extra expense. Hopefully these are made in the USA instead of China like most other things we buy in America.

"I owned two of these oven locks (one at my old house, one after I moved). I LOVE them. At first try, I didn't think it was going to fit. But, I installed it anyway. I'm glad I did. Even though the oven handle is too close to the oven to make this work like the picture (if you have this lock, you know what I mean), it really isn't a problem. I just slide the lock open, and pull the oven handle forward. As the oven door pulls forward, this gives enough clearance for the top of the lock (that flips out) to actually flip out. I know this confusing, but I just wanted to let everybody know that there IS a way to make this work for most ovens. It is not diffucult to operate (even my in-laws, who abhore child-safety items because they are too much of a hastle) don't complain about this item.Never had an adhesion problems, even though I used this lock with the when self-cleaning the ovens(the instructions state that the lock can't be used while self-cleaning, but I can't figure out how one would avoid that). The lock looks good (as good as any babyproofing item can), and allows me to have my small children in the kitchen with me.

It slides right in and out of an F hole with no problem. I plugged it into my Fender amp with a little reverb and WOW is how I can describe what came out. It sounded like I was in a Great Concert Hall. Of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp.

"I am not a studio engineer, nor am I a professional musician.  I record songs in my home as a hobby.  I like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting, so if you're at or around the same level, you know what I'm talking about.  Will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much?  No.  Are you likely to find it in a high-end professional studio?  Eh...probably not.  Is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point?  Hells yes.I've worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious, and this is the nicest mic I own right now.  The difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious.  I use it for recording vocals, and my voice (again, not a pro!) is finicky to record, usually sounding pretty muddy.  Even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals (SM57 and 58) this was still the case.  But with this mic, my voice sounds much more clear and open.Admittedly, this is a very subjective evaluation, but then aren't all mic evaluations subjective?  You can go on all day about response range and EQ flatness, but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application.  And to my ears, this mic sounds wonderful.My only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesn't seem to be a super-tight cardioid, because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it.  Perhaps this is how it's supposed to be, but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously, it can be a headache trying to jury-rig an isolation method that works.  I took off a star for this alone, although that may not be fair since I haven't used any other large-diaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if they're all supposed to behave this way.",music,studio engineer professional musician record songs home hobby like reasonably nice gear order get good sound possible setting around level know talking compare mic costs three times much likely find high end professional studio eh probably pretty sweet deal price point hells yes worked way terms mic quality hobby gotten progressively serious nicest mic right difference quality even nice dynamic mic immediately obvious use recording vocals voice pro finicky record usually sounding pretty muddy even nicer dynamic mics usually used vocals sm still case mic voice sounds much clear open admittedly subjective evaluation mic evaluations subjective go day response range eq flatness matters end mic sounds application ears mic sounds wonderful real gripe sensitivity pattern seem super tight cardioid still picks sound coming behind perhaps supposed trying record vocals loud electric guitar simultaneously headache trying jury rig isolation method works took star alone although may fair since used large diaphragm condensers therefore idea supposed behave way

I have been using this product almost daily for about the past 6 weeks and I'm happy to say that I see great improvement in my lashes.  My top lashes have always been really long and think but my bottom lashes never seemed to be a good match for my top ones.  They seemed way to short and thin in comparison.  I've used this product a bit more on my bottom than on my top lashes and it's evened them out quite a bit.  My bottom lashes are longer and fuller now.  I'm quite happy with the results.My only real complaint with this product would be that some of my lashes seem to grow at odd angles now.  It's not horrible but it seems that I'm trying to control how they lay when using mascara now and I never had to do that before.Overall I'm very pleased with this product and I would highly recommend it.

The container had directions for adding boiling water or microwaving - so you could add hot water from a coffee pot, nuke it, etc. But it's very quick and easy just to nuke the thing.It's also ideal for traveling, motor homes, etc. I could even see this on a camping trip - no cleanup!

"This is a product that is unique, tiny and would be very useful-- if it were more accurate.  The problem is it's just not responsive enough.  To get it to work one has to place it low on the headpiece (next to the nut) and strum a string pretty loud for a consistent register.  Placing it at the top of the headpiece it simply doesn't pick up enough string vibration to register well.The problem with placing it next to the nut is that it then makes it impossible to hang the guitar on a wall-mount guitar hanger.  That may seem like a small issue... but not if you use such a device regularly (as many home-players do).  Myself, I have 5 guitars hanging on my living room wall.That doesn't make this valueless.  You can always clip it on the top of the headpiece and then move it when you're ready to tune.  Thus I give it 3 stars.  However there are other more responsive tuners, such as the capo-tuners we've seen on Amazon lately.  They're about the same price (actually, the capo tuners are a bit less-expensive) but I've found the capo-tuners to be considerably more responsive.So bottom line, I'm not impressed.  These aren't an expensive tuner comparatively speaking, and that's good.  But they' really don't do all that great a job.  They're unresponsive enough that I honestly think a person might break a string before realizing the tuner isn't responding to the current string pluck.Note to Ovation guitar players:  this is not the clip-on tuner for you.  There's simply no place to clip it.  Fortunately my Ovation has built-in tuning, but if you have an Ovation Acoustic, you'll want a different tuner.",music,product unique tiny would useful accurate problem responsive enough get work one place low headpiece next nut strum string pretty loud consistent register placing top headpiece simply pick enough string vibration register well problem placing next nut makes impossible hang guitar wall mount guitar hanger may seem like small issue use device regularly many home players guitars hanging living room wall make valueless always clip top headpiece move ready tune thus give stars however responsive tuners capo tuners seen amazon lately price actually capo tuners bit less expensive found capo tuners considerably responsive bottom line impressed expensive tuner comparatively speaking good really great job unresponsive enough honestly think person might break string realizing tuner responding current string pluck note ovation guitar players clip tuner simply place clip fortunately ovation built tuning ovation acoustic want different tuner

"Review of Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex, Sensitive:The manufacturer advertises Hydroxatone as ""a multi functional anti-aging powerhouse and moisturizer for those with sensitive skin that softens the appearance of visible lines, wrinkles and crow's feet by helping the skin stimulate the production of collagen. This one product serves as your daytime moisturizer, your nighttime moisturizer and your anti-aging treatment all in one.""  Bold promises that do deliver.  However, although the moisturizing effects of the creme do reduce wrinkle lines (crow's feet), it is a temporary effect lasting approximately 4-6 hours.

"The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built. They were right. It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put.

"I'm not sure that custard is really custard without eggs.  But this comes close.  I got it for use in a ""Vegan pancake"" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.If you want a really good egg-free ""custard"" get an original recipe for ""blanc mange.""

"I really wanted to have the pretty curls I see so often but this tool doesn't do it for me.  I'm old school - grew up using hot rollers (the hard plastic kind that melt if you leave them plugged in too long) and curling irons.  I have a curler brush that is great for getting tangled in my hair if I'm in a hurry.  This is the first time I've tried a Waving Wand and it is also the last.  First of all, for those of you who aren't familiar with this product, there is no clamp like you have with a traditional curling iron.  Instead, you have a heat resistant glove and you carefully wrap your hair around the wand.  This is not an easy task to do and at the same time you are trying not to touch your ear, face, etc. with this hot instrument.  I'm right handed and found it impossible to create the waves on the right side of my head.  on the left side I managed a couple but mostly I just created a mess.  This alone would have gotten three stars since it does get hot and if I had any skill at this process I probably would have had some kind of curl when I was finished.  However, the controls for the heat settings, etc. are right under your hand so I kept changing the temp as I wrapped hair around it.

"Unless the purpose of this cereal is that it be a vehicle for milk, I'm confused as to why anyone would choose this over a healthier, less sugary breakfast food.  The first ingredient is chocolate filling, and the filling's first ingredient is sugar.  Then the next ingredient is sugar.  You get the idea.By making the ""serving size"" 3/4 cup, a ""serving"" of this cereal is only 120 calories, but clearly most bowls would hold twice that, at least, and most of them are from the sugar--there is almost no protein in this cereal.

It is about 1 cm thick, if it compresses let's say to half of that in an accident, the gap between baby and seat belt/ car seat (0.5cm) would be insignificant.

My son was 6 months old when I first got this and he wasn't too awful interested.  Now 3 months later he seems to like it a little bit more but still not as much as I expected/hoped.

The company should give more consideration to be able to make small adjustments when installing. That is my main ""complaint"" and thus I'm not rating it 5 stars. Oh, also these are rather expensive but I suppose they are worth it considering that my other locks were more of a waste because they had to be replaced when they were defeated.",baby,child easily started defeating locks push unlatch months reaches arm undoes lock switching nice except installation go well must installed almost exactly correct work right little high low could problems easily adjustable frustrating installed exactly correct latch right close right open right etc company give consideration able make small adjustments installing main complaint thus rating stars oh also rather expensive suppose worth considering locks waste replaced defeated
My hair is so much softer and more manageable now that I have been using the Deva product line. I love it so much and I try to get everyone who has curly hair to use it. I never loved my hair until I read Curly Girl and started using the product line. Now I'm so proud of my unique curls. Definitely give it a try and give it a good month or so for your hair to start changing. It doesn't happen overnight!,beauty,hair much softer manageable using deva product line love much try get everyone curly hair use never loved hair read curly girl started using product line proud unique curls definitely give try give good month hair start changing happen overnight
I really like this product. It's simple and I don't know how many toys or pacifiers I would lose without it.the only real con that I have is after some use(like 3 months)  they begin to fray. Given the price replacing them after a few months isn't a big deal. Definitely a life saver when we are out or for walks,baby,really like product simple know many toys pacifiers would lose without real con use like months begin fray given price replacing months big deal definitely life saver walks

"I have been searching for an overnight moisturizer other than vaseline or eucerin's aquaphor. I feel these products don't last as long overnight compared to this Jergen's cream. It is an excellent overnight cream, although be warned, it does not absorb quickly so you might find your hair getting stuck to your face. A little annoying but I think this is necessary to provide a lasting barrier to keep your skin moist throughout the night. I use this on top of an acne treatment and it has been working very well.What alarmed me when I received my tub though is that it was not sealed! I was hesitant to use it at first but just crossed my fingers and I'm glad I took the risk.

I purchased these based on others recommendations. The rice cakes are delicious. Thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets. Dense...not full of air. I covered them with PB2 (those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular PB and it tastes exactly the same). I too highly recommend these rice cakes.,grocery,purchased based others recommendations rice cakes delicious thinner usual rice cakes supermarkets dense full air covered pb watching weight eat peanut butter calories serving vs regular pb tastes exactly highly recommend rice cakes
We got this for our baby girl and at the time she was 5 months old. Then she was a little small even for the lowest setting and we would place a folded up blanket under her feet and a small towel behind her back so she could grab the toys. It took her a few weeks but then she liked being able to move and jump on her own.Now baby is 8 months old and it is fantastic!! It is still on the smallest setting and fits her well. This means we still have plenty on grown room so will fit her for a while (thank god!)She likes to play with the toys on the jumper while watching her favorite show giving myself a well needed Mummy break.She uses it at least 2 times a day for around 40min. At her age she gets frustrated because she cant crawl very well but wants to be mobile and in the jumper she feels like she is moving by her self but in a controlled environment for parents.NEGATIVES:One annoying thing is that one toy falls off every now and then but my baby smiles and it proud of her self. Not a choking hazard so I don't care.Gets marks on her legs when not wearing pants. Not sure if it is just her as she is a good little jumper,baby,got baby girl time months old little small even lowest setting would place folded blanket feet small towel behind back could grab toys took weeks liked able move jump baby months old fantastic still smallest setting fits well means still plenty grown room fit thank god likes play toys jumper watching favorite show giving well needed mummy break uses least times day around min age gets frustrated cant crawl well wants mobile jumper feels like moving self controlled environment parents negatives one annoying thing one toy falls every baby smiles proud self choking hazard care gets marks legs wearing pants sure good little jumper

"I liked these a lot. For the price they work very well, and I am very happy that I bought them. I got a couple of those straight-coupler things, but really their use is quite limited because input jack heights on different effects pedals are rarely the same height so you can't use the straight-couplers.

"I like this product very much. I got mainly blue and green, with 2 oranges, 2 pinks, and 1 red and 1 purple. The colors were beautiful, and I loved them. However, I would have liked to get that pink one that is in the picture. The containers are shipped to you in a plastic bag, and the caps are not screwed on very well. I was lucky enough to have all of my caps on at least. The containers are about an inch in diameter, and 3 centimeters tall, with it being only half full. There is loose glitter in the bag, so I would recommend that you put the glitters down on a wet paper towel, so that the glitter doesn't get everywhere. Overall, I would probably buy it again, coming from a 14 year old.",beauty,like product much got mainly blue green oranges pinks red purple colors beautiful loved however would liked get pink one picture containers shipped plastic bag caps screwed well lucky enough caps least containers inch diameter centimeters tall half full loose glitter bag would recommend put glitters wet paper towel glitter get everywhere overall would probably buy coming year old

"I have been using an old elastic-bar capo for years because the last spring capo I used did not have nearly enough tension. When I first applied the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo I thought ""here we go again."" There was ample tension E-G but B and E were buzzy as all get out. Not expecting much, I adjusted the tension. It took a couple of tries to get it just right, but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar... zero buzz across the board. That in and of itself, makes this capo a five in my book. Add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze (on and off), it looks nice (I have the black version), as well as its comparative ease on the wallet, and this capo is a rock solid five star product.This capo also has a pick holder. The feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capo's overall size and shape, but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itself.Get this capo!",music,using old elastic bar capo years last spring capo used nearly enough tension first applied planet waves tri action capo thought go ample tension e g b e buzzy get expecting much adjusted tension took couple tries get right capo works made specifically guitar zero buzz across board makes capo five book add facts release mechanism breeze looks nice black version well comparative ease wallet capo rock solid five star product capo also pick holder feature actually little awkward placement context capo overall size shape need detract functionality capo get capo

"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on, which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch, so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle, and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah, but in my experience, the sound is equivalent on the base models.",music,problem pedal step way turn produces sound morley pedals separate switch turn given position difference sound bit professional wah always turning top wah frequency suppose wanted set wah middle leave really pedal bit smaller morley wah experience sound equivalent base models

I don't really have crows feet or bags under my eyes (with or without cream) so I can't say how it would work with firming the skin.  As far as minimizing the appearance of fine lines - it accomplishes that as well as any moisturizer I have tried.That being said, it is a wonderful light weight cream.
